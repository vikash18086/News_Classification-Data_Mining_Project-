News classification is a supervised learning task in which news articles are assigned to
categories based on the training. This project focuses in the field of data mining. With the rapid
growth of online text data, text categorization has become an essential technique for handling and
dealing with this vast amount of data. To build a classifier manually is very difficult and timeconsuming,
so the better way is to make a classifier learn from examples.
In this project first we categorized the news and then based on sentiment analysis we can able to answer either 
the news is positive or negative.
