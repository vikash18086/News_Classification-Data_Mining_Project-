News classification is a supervised learning
task in which news articles are assigned to
categories based on the training. This project
focuses in the field of data mining. With the rapid
growth of online text data, text categorization has
become an essential technique for handling and
dealing with this vast amount of data. To build a
classifier manually is very difficult and timeconsuming,
so the better way is to make a
classifier learn from examples.
In this project, we are using LDA (Linear
Discriminant Allocation), Random Forest,
SVM(Support Vector Machine) and Na√Øve Byes
classifiers to classify text. After crawling the news
data from the internet, preprocessing it then
training the model with 80% of data and testing it
on remaining 20% to check the accuracy to the
trained model.
