Mullis has not been able to purchase the property on which the track sits from the California landowner because they disagree on the purchase price Mullis has leased the track from the landowner the previous six seasons but has said it would be more viable financially for him to operate the track by purchasing it  Minus a purchase agreement or lease track management has not released a schedule for the  season and during the past week has moved much of its property off of the premises In addition Langley Speedway management did not re with NASCAR for three races run at the track annually one in the K Pro Series East and two others in the Whelen Southern Modified Tour Series  Hall and Mullis who could not be reached for comment have not announced they are pulling out of Langley  are ongoing Hall said Tuesday when asked about the future of Langley

The Hamlin charity race was expected to be one of the biggest events in track history Reuss said that in addition to Hamlin he expected his Joe Gibbs Racing teammates  Sprint Cup Series champion Kyle Busch and  Cup champ Matt Kenseth to also be part of the Showdown field  But Reuss said that Denny Hamlin Foundation management feels it is impossible to organize the race now with the uncertainty that Langley Speedway will open In addition to driver commitments Reuss said most of the money raised comes from people associated with drivers other than Hamlin and that those sponsors also needed to know race specifics by early January to commit their funds Reuss said there would be logistical difficulties in organizing the race after early January such as setting race rules and procedures and getting NASCAR licensing He said that the race will resume again in  and he hopes that it will be at Langley Langley has never hosted the Short Track Showdown  Previous hosts were Southside Speedway

British and American intelligence agencies had a comprehensive list of surveillance targets that included the EU competition commissioner German government buildings in Berlin and overseas and the heads of institutions that provide humanitarian and financial help to Africa top documents reveal papers show GCHQ in collaboration with America National Security Agency  was targeting organisations such as the United Nations development programme the UN children charity Unicef and M du Monde a French organisation that provides doctors and medical volunteers to conflict zones The head of the Economic Community of West African States  also appears in the documents along with text messages he sent to colleagues latest disclosures will add to Washington embarrassment after the heavy criticism of the NSA when it emerged that it had been tapping the mobile phone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel GCHQ document drafted in January  makes clear that the agencies were targeting an email address listed as belonging to another important American ally  the  prime minister Ehud Olmert was in office at the time further Israeli targets appeared on GCHQ documents including another email address understood to have been used to send messages between the then Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak and his chief of staff Yoni Koren names that appear in the GCHQ documents include Joaqu Almunia a Spaniard who is vice of the European commission with responsibility for competition policy targeting of Germany may also prove awkward for the prime minister David Cameron in October he endorsed an EU statement condemning NSA spying on world leaders including Merkel have both been in Brussels attending an EU summit that concludes on Friday names and details are the latest revelations to come from documents leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden They provoked a furious reaction from the European commission Almunia and others on the target lists The commission said the disclosures  unacceptable and deserve our strongest condemnation This is not the type of behaviour that we expect from strategic partners let alone from our own member states Almunia said he was  upset to discover his name was on GCHQ documents Leigh Daynes UK executive director of M du Monde said he was  by these extraordinary allegations of secret surveillance Our doctors nurses and midwives are not a threat to national security There is absolutely no reason for our operations to be secretly monitored Another target Nicolas Imboden the head of an NGO that provides help to African countries said the spying on him was  economic espionage and politically motivated Human Rights Watch Privacy International and Big Brother Watch condemned the targeting Labour said the committee that oversees GCHQ should be given extra powers disclosures reflect the breadth of targets sought by the agencies which goes far beyond the desire to intercept the communications of potential terrorists and criminals or diplomats and officials from hostile countries Asked about this activity a spokesman for GCHQ said it was  policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters but the official maintained the agency  its obligations under the law very seriously new information is published after a joint investigation by the Guardian the German news magazine Der Spiegel and the New York Times According to documents the targeting efforts involved programmes run from GCHQ listening post near the small Cornish seaside resort of Bude This is a key listening facility that receives substantial funding from the NSA to undertake shared transatlantic surveillance operations other activities the base was tasked with monitoring satellite communications between Europe and Africa and the papers show that Bude tested the value of new  used by telecoms companies to judge whether they would be worth intercepting to documents dated from  to  a unit at Bude did this by testing samples of data to see whether surveillance targets already on GCHQ and NSA databases were making use of the new connections GCHQ analysts identified a carrier they thought could be useful they would be asked  this carrier be tasked on collection system more permanent surveillance would often depend on whether GCHQ had suitable software and if not whether it was possible to upgrade systems to make it possible is in charge of major anti investigations and approving mergers of companies with significant presence in the EU He has been involved in a long investigation into Google over complaints about the company alleged stranglehold on online advertising He has also clashed with Google and Microsoft over privacy concerns and was prominent in the EU response to the global financial crisis on such a senior EU official with a major role in economic affairs is bound to alarm other European nations and raise concerns as to whether intelligence produced from Almunia or others is shared with the US  the NSA has a number of personnel at the base in Bude and contributes millions of pounds to its budget target was the French defence and logistics giant Thales Group which is part by the French government all communications from more than  countries were targeted in this particular operation with other names listed in the GCHQ documents including Mohamed Ibn Chambas the current African Union Nations joint special representative for Darfur as well as multiple African heads of state from the non Ideas Centre in Geneva and Solomon Asamoah deputy head of the Africa Finance Corporation also appeared on GCHQ lists documents do not give any insight into why GCHQ deemed them worthy of surveillance  Chambas was president of Ecowas He had been closely involved in efforts to bring peace to Liberia and GCHQ picked up text messages he sent while in the country to receive an award message read  Kwame Glad to know all is well Am in Liberia for receive National Award  inde celebration A second added  machine gun sounds Am in Gbanga former HQ of Charles Taylor  operated by the UN development programme which administers financial relief to poor nations and of the World Health Organisation were also among listed targets targeting of German government buildings may prove the biggest political headache for the UK The documents show GCHQ targeting German government networks in Berlin and official communications between Germany and Georgia and Germany and Turkey Germany embassy in Rwanda was also a target papers seen by the Guardian do not disclose the extent of any surveillance or for how long any collection took place each individual or group had a specific ID number in the agency  knowledge base This indicates they had been a deliberate target of surveillance efforts rather than accidentally caught in a dragnet its US counterpart GCHQ is entitled to engage in spying relating to economic matters but only if it is linked to national security issues  Intelligence and Security Act says the agency can work  the interests of national security with particular reference to the defence and foreign policies of Her Majesty government in the interests of the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom and in support of the prevention and the detection of serious crime However critics have repeatedly called for a proper definition of  security and raised questions about what should be permitted to protect  wellbeing beyond the need to help UK companies defend themselves against the theft of intellectual property or from cyber show GCHQ has also been keen to break into global roaming exchanges  as GRXs which are centres that handle routing international mobile calls to the appropriate countries and phone networks Belgacom which Der Spiegel revealed this year was the victim of GCHQ hacking efforts is one such international exchange  presentation referring to the agency efforts against GRXs went on to note that  targets from all nations have an MO  operandi of using smartphones and added the agency had  this use at the G meetings last year The Guardian in June revealed GCHQ had engaged in extensive surveillance efforts against G delegates in  including in order to secure advantages in trade talks and bilaterals Monday the Guardian Der Spiegel and the New York Times jointly approached GCHQ for comment The agency would not go into any details but said  of the purposes for which GCHQ may be authorised to intercept communications is where it is necessary for the purpose of safeguarding the economic wellbeing of the UK However the code of practice made clear this had to be  related to state security Interception under this purpose is categorically not about industrial espionage NSA said  we have previously said we do not use our foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of  or give intelligence we collect to  US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line The United States collects foreign intelligence just as many other governments do intelligence community efforts to understand economic systems and policies and monitor anomalous economic activities are critical to providing policymakers with the information they need to make informed decisions that are in the best interest of our national security As the administration also announced several

Smile Foundation is a national level development organisation directly benefitting over  children and their families every year through  welfare projects on education healthcare livelihood and women empowerment in more than  remote villages and slums across  states of India

Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life the means because it empowers an individual to earn his livelihood and the end because it increases one awareness on a range of issues  from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one rights  and in the process help him evolve as a better citizen

Doubtless education is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation But child education cannot be done in isolation A child will go to school only if the family particularly the mother is assured of healthcare and empowered Moreover when an elder sibling is relevantly skilled to be employable and begins earning the journey of empowerment continues beyond the present generation

Realizing this Smile Foundation beginning in the corridors of education adopted a lifecycle approach of development focusing its interventions on children their families and the larger community

Smile Foundation believes that unless members of the civil society are involved proactively in the process of development sustainable change will not happen Following this model of Civic Driven Change Smile Foundation sensitizes and engages the civil society making it an active partner in all its welfare initiatives

Today  million children in India are out of school  surrounded by poverty illness and despair they are fighting a daily battle for their survival Together we can bring hope in their lives Together we can bring change and make it last

 youth to receive training at  new STeP centres

While metropolitan cities offer a plethora of career choices and lucrative job options to youth those from the socio marginalized segments of society are often left out 

As children these youth could not complete their education because of extreme conditions at home Later they could not get a decent job because of lack of the required skill set Many of them would have ended up continuing with their parents profession mostly labour work or low paid temporary jobs without ever hoping for even basic financial and social security and their children would have probably shared a similar fate 

Smile Foundation STeP programme is an attempt to break this cycle at an early stage The programme enrols urban underprivileged youth and trains them in market oriented job skills such as computers communication retail management marketing and personality development These youth are then placed in reputed brands from the retail and service sector finally stepping towards a dignified and independent livelihood

Mothers cherish the joy of learning in Guna MP

More than  mothers have begun to cherish the joy of learning at Adult Education Centres established under the Integrated Education and Health programme in Guna district in Madhya Pradesh These women who had never been to school before were  to learn by their children who are regular students at our Mission Education centres

Tags Federal Trade Commission and  law enforcement partners from every state and the District of Columbia have charged four sham cancer charities and their operators with bilking more than  million from consumers The defendants told donors their money would help cancer patients including children and women suffering from breast cancer but the overwhelming majority of donations benefitted only the perpetrators their families and friends and fundraisers This is one of the largest actions brought to date by enforcers against charity fraud in the federal court complaint are Cancer Fund of America Inc  Cancer Support Services Inc  their president James Reynolds Sr and their chief financial officer and CSS former president Kyle Effler Children Cancer Fund of America Inc  and its president and executive director Rose Perkins and The Breast Cancer Society Inc  and its executive director and former president James Reynolds II and Perkins BCS Reynolds II and Effler have agreed to settle the charges against them Under the proposed settlement orders Effler Perkins and Reynolds II will be banned from fundraising charity management and oversight of charitable assets and CCFOA and BCS will be dissolved Litigation will continue against CFA CSS and James Reynolds Sr is a debilitating disease that impacts millions of Americans and their families every year The defendants egregious scheme effectively deprived legitimate cancer charities and cancer patients of much funds and support said Jessica Rich Director of the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection  defendants took in millions of dollars in donations meant to help cancer patients but spent it on themselves and their fundraisers pleased that the FTC and our state partners are acting to end this appalling scheme Attorney General Mark Herring said  allegations of fundraising for personal gain in the name of children with cancer and women battling breast cancer are simply shameful This is the first time the FTC all  states and the District of Columbia have filed a joint enforcement action alleging deceptive solicitations by charities and I hope it serves as a strong warning for anyone trying to exploit the kindness and generosity of others Carolina Secretary of State Mark Hammond said  charities lie to donors it is our duty to step in to protect them the same time however this historic action should remind everyone to be vigilant when giving to charity case is an unfortunate example of why I always tell my constituents to give from the heart but give smart to the complaint the defendants used telemarketing calls direct mail websites and materials distributed by the Combined Federal Campaign which raises money from federal employees for non organizations to portray themselves as legitimate charities with substantial programs that provided direct support to cancer patients in the United States such as providing patients with pain medication transportation to chemotherapy and hospice care In fact the complaint alleges that these claims were deceptive and that the charities  as personal fiefdoms characterized by rampant nepotism flagrant conflicts of interest and excessive insider compensation with none of the financial and governance controls that any bona fide charity would have adopted to the complaint the defendants used the organizations for lucrative employment for family members and friends and spent consumer donations on cars trips luxury cruises college tuition gym memberships jet ski outings sporting event and concert tickets and dating site memberships They hired professional fundraisers who often received  percent or more of every donation complaint alleges that to hide their high administrative and fundraising costs from donors and regulators the defendants falsely inflated their revenues by reporting in publicly filed financial documents more than  million in donated  in kind which they claimed to distribute to international recipients In fact the defendants were merely pass agents for such goods By reporting the inflated  in kind donations the defendants created the illusion that they were larger and more efficient with donors dollars than they actually were Thirty states alleged that the defendants filed false and misleading financial statements with state charities regulators addition the FTC and  states charged CFA CCFOA and BCS with providing professional fundraisers with deceptive fundraising materials The FTC and the attorneys general also charged the defendants with violating the FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule  CFA CCFOA and BCS with assisting and facilitating in TSR violations and CSS with making deceptive charitable solicitations addition to the bans imposed on charity work by the settling individual defendants and the dissolution of two corporations CCFOA and BCS the proposed final order against CCFOA and Rose Perkins imposes a judgment of  the amount consumers donated between  and  The judgment against CCFOA will be partially satisfied via liquidation of its assets the judgment against Perkins will be suspended based upon her inability to pay proposed final orders against BCS and Reynolds II impose a  judgment the amount consumers donated between  and  The BCS order provides an option subject to court approval for spinning off its Hope Supply Warehouses program to a legitimate qualified charity BCS remaining assets will be liquidated and used to partially satisfy the judgment The judgment against Reynolds II will be suspended when he pays  proposed final order against Effler will impose a judgment of  the amount consumers donated to CSS between  and  The judgment will be suspended upon payment of  The full judgment amounts against the individuals will become due immediately if they are found to have misrepresented their financial condition Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint and proposed stipulated final orders was  documents were filed in the U District Court for the District of Arizona The proposed orders are subject to court approval The Commission files a complaint when it has  to believe that the law has been or is being violated and it appears

Liz Scott Alex mother and co director of Alex Lemonade Stand Foundation stated in an e to ALL in May  that  Lemonade Stand Foundation has not funded anything even remotely related to embryonic stem cell research when it was pointed out to Mrs Scott that according to the Foundation website there were grant funds being directed toward researchers and research facilities that support promote and conduct such research she responded we have not issued a public policy position I can tell you that ALSF has always followed all federal guidelines for research that involves human cells and tissues We are very sensitive to the variety of opinions on issues related to stem cells and are committed to funding research programs that meet all of the stringent ethical standards at the institutional foundation and government levels that are designed to find cures for childhood cancer  can tell you that when we award funds to our grant recipients  of the funds are used for their project only institution is not allowed to take any indirect costs or general operating costs from the award funds or to use funds for other projects cautions that federal guidelines allow for both human embryonic stem cell research and the use of aborted fetal materials in research contacted  email in July  with an update request someone by the name of Lisa responded do not have a policy We have never received an application that includes embryonic stem cells so this isn an issue for us asked what the organization would do if it did receive a grant application that involved the use of human embryonic stem cells or aborted fetal material there was no further reply for Aging Research

The Alliance for Aging Research is a  group that advocates for medical research and scientific discoveries to improve the health and independence of Americans as they age  such the Alliance supports public policies that advance research involving both adult and embryonic stem cells and regenerative medicine in general the Alliance for Aging Research opposes efforts to copy human life through cloning technologies it is a leader among patient groups and science advocates supporting public funding for broad activities in stem cell research as well as therapeutic cloning of compatible stem cell lines for research and potential therapies On its own and through membership in the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research the Alliance will support the enactment of legislation to encourage increased federal funding for advances in stem cell research

 Alliance for Regenerative Medicine  mission is to advance regenerative medicine by representing supporting and engaging all stakeholders in the field including companies academic research institutions patient advocacy groups foundations health insurers financial institutions and other organizations to the website regenerative medicine includes cell therapies gene therapy biologics tissue engineering bio and stem cells for drug discovery toxicity testing and disease modeling It is this last branch of regenerative medicine which causes the most concern  are increasingly learning to leverage the use of stem cells and living tissue constructs to create in vitro models to study human mechanisms of disease and the effects of drugs on a variety of cell and tissue types such as human heart liver and brain cells These models built predominantly using embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells allow for faster and safer drug development

In an email to ALL from Carrie Munk at the ALS Association July   ALS Association primarily funds adult stem cell research  The Association is funding one study using embryonic stem cells  and the stem cell line was established many years ago under ethical guidelines set by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  this research is funded by one specific donor who is committed to this area of research  fact donors may stipulate that their funds not be invested in this study or any stem cell project Under very strict guidelines The Association may fund embryonic stem cell research in the future ALS Association also financially supports NEALS  Northeast ALS Consortium which performs human embryonic stem cell research ALS Association Awards  to the NEALS Consortium for Its TREAT ALS Clinical Trials Network

For the sixth consecutive year The ALS Association is pleased to announce its support of the Northeast ALS Consortium  the largest consortium of ALS clinical researchers in the world This year award totals  and will fund new initiatives and ongoing programs that will increase the quality and efficiency of clinical trials for ALS  Northeast ALS Consortium  is an international independent non group of researchers who collaboratively conduct clinical research in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  and other motor neuron diseases utilizing the spinal cord neural stem cells from electively aborted fetus Association

 Alzheimer Association policy supports and encourages any legitimate scientific avenue that offers the potential to advance this goal including human embryonic stem cell research and we oppose any restriction or limitation on research provided that appropriate scientific review and ethical and oversight guidelines and compliance are in place

The American Cancer Society is not considered a pro organization for the following reasons for human embryonic stem cell researchThe American Cancer Society  has for many years insisted that the federal government  the institution best suited to both fund and oversee research using human embryonic stem cells while claiming to fund only  into uses of human adult stem cells and stem cells from umbilical cord blood in August  when then Bush signed an executive order restricting federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to stem cell lines that were already in existence at the time the ACS issued a statement commending the administration for allowing stem cell research to proceed and expressed hope for its future Society believes that such research holds extraordinary potential in the fight against a variety of life diseases currently afflicting an estimated  million Americans the statement said It continued  American Cancer Society commends the Administration for allowing this vital scientific research to proceed in a limited way American Cancer Society remains hopeful that both the government and commercial sectors will continue to work collaboratively and with an open mind to explore additional solutions that will allow for the continuation of human embryonic stem cell research as necessary and appropriate the ACS statement concluded statements can no longer be found on the ACS website but can be viewed here

The American Council on Science and Health  is a consumer education consortium concerned with issues related to food nutrition chemicals pharmaceuticals lifestyle the environment and health  was founded in  by a group of scientists who had become concerned that many important public policies related to health and the environment did not have a sound scientific basis These scientists created the organization to add reason and balance to debates about public health issues and to bring common sense views to the public

We strongly support the protection and expansion of all forms of stem cell research which offer great hope for a cure and better treatments for diabetes We support legislation and proposals that enhance funding for stem cell research at the federal and state levels

The American Heart Association website states the following regarding stem cell research Cell Research

The American Heart Association funds meritorious research involving human adult stem cells  because it helps us fight heart disease and stroke We don fund research involving stem cells derived from human embryos or fetal tissue

However it continues adult stem cells into a pluripotent state may lead to patient cell therapies that could reduce many of the underlying complications in therapies with embryonic stem cells important for research to continue in both cell types To know how induced adult stem cells need to perform we must know more about the innate function of embryonic stem cells

The American Lung Association recognizes that research with human stem cells offer significant potential to further our understanding of fundamental lung biology and to develop cell therapies to treat lung disease The American Lung Association supports the responsible pursuit of research involving the use of human stem cells

Amnesty International defends access to abortion for women at risk

In April  Amnesty International changed its neutral stance on abortion to supporting access to abortion in cases of rape and incest and when the life or the health of the mother might be threatened Amnesty official policy is that they  not promote abortion as a universal right but  the decriminalisation of abortion

Amnesty International a human rights organization that used to be abortion neutral is now using the problem of maternal mortality to advocate for abortion In a new report ostensibly on medical care for maternal health Amnesty calls on governments to repeal abortion laws and conscience protection for medical workers who may object They also call for public health systems to train and equip health care providers to perform abortions  Health is a Human Right campaign focuses attention on four countries Sierra Leone Burkina Faso Peru and the United States Amnesty argues that maternal mortality will decrease if it is treated as a human rights issue if costs to health care are covered by governments and if a right for women to control their reproductive and sex lives is established

The Sabrina Cohen Foundation  is a  nonprofit organization dedicated to funding cutting edge research and innovative therapies that will improve the quality of life for individuals living with spinal cord injuries and other disabilities funds scientists dedicated to advancing the field of Regenerative Medicine primarily focused on conditions in the Central Nervous System In  SCF donated its first research grant of  to the University of California Irvine where studies of restoring mobility in paralyzed rats and research on spinal cord injuries yielded the world first FDA approved embryonic stem cell treatment to be tested in humans

The website for the International Office of the Salvation Army  states the following Salvation Army believes all people are created in the image of God and therefore have unique and intrinsic value Human life is sacred and all people should be treated with dignity and respect The Salvation Army accepts the moment of fertilisation as the start of human life We believe that society has a responsibility to care for others and especially to protect and promote the welfare of vulnerable people including unborn children Salvation Army believes that life is a gift from God and we are answerable to God for the taking of life As such The Salvation Army is concerned about the growing ready acceptance of abortion which reflects insufficient concern for vulnerable persons including the unborn We do not believe that genetic abnormalities that are identified in an unborn child who is likely to live longer than a brief period after birth are sufficient to warrant a termination of pregnancy Salvation Army recognizes tragic and perplexing circumstances that require difficult decisions regarding a pregnancy Decisions should be made only after prayerful and thoughtful consideration acknowledging the tremendous pressures that occur during an unexpected pregnancy There is a responsibility on all involved to give the parents of the unborn child particularly the woman appropriate pastoral medical and other counsel The Salvation Army believes that termination can occur only whenIn addition rape and incest are brutal acts of dominance violating women physically and emotionally This situation represents a special case for the consideration of termination as the violation may be compounded by the continuation of the pregnancy FROM ALL A reading of the Salvation Army position makes it clear that it does support abortion  in the cases of  of the mother and  deformity  as well as some cases of rape and incest  Salvation Army also supports abortifacient birth control Choice Pharmaceutical Institute

Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute  is a  non organization dedicated to providing scientific research education and resources to encourage safe moral pro medicines and therapeutics  founding mission of Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute  is to new generation of scientists and medical professionals is rising full of strength and hope and founded on the respect of the human being from his beginning to natural death  working on safe vaccines and effective stem cell therapy the scientists and students at SCPI seek to provide the freedom to all Americans to choose moral treatment for themselves and for their children and in this way to participate in the culture of life in regards to disease treatment and prevention Our cadre of dedicated professionals realize that the true promise of moral stem cell research must be advanced to help those with degenerative diseases both now and for future generations Bifida Association

The Spina Bifida Association did not respond to ALL questionnaire but did inform our independent researcher that  Spina Bifida Association has not adopted a policy statement on cloning stem cells or fetal research did not locate anything on the SBA website that would contradict this statement SBA Women Health Information Sheet includes the statement that  is possible for almost all women with Spina Bifida so appropriate contraception is strongly recommended if pregnancy is not currently desired and artificial forms are referred to  information sheet also highly recommends the HPV vaccine

St Baldrick Foundation funds cannot be used for human embryonic stem cell research This is not a statement on whether or not we think it should be supported the decision is based on the fact that many of our donors and volunteers  our source of funds  would not be comfortable supporting it Stem cell transplantations not using human embryonic stem cells  using cord blood or matched donors  are often used in treating childhood cancer patients and our funds may be used in this non area of research

The following information is lengthy however it boils down to the fact that there are doctors on staff at St Jude Children Research Hospital who are either supportive of or involved in human embryonic stem cell research and SJCRH refuses to reply to ALL written correspondence concerning these staff  Jude Children Research Hospital has not publicly stated an unequivocal condemnation of anti research practices and ALL will continue to give this organization a negative rating on this website until it does  

A review of the St Jude Children Research Hospital website indicates that the three doctors referred to in correspondence below are still on staff at the facility  appears also that each continues to be involved in and supportive of human embryonic stem cell research particularly Dr S McKinney who co additional scientifc research papers in  with Dr George Daley who has been involved in iPS stem cell research further correspondence has been received from SJCRH and no publicly stated unequivocal condemnation of human embryonic stem cell research has come from St Jude Children Research Hospital  

ALL has on more than one occasion written to St Jude Children Research Hospital via certified letter  have been signed for asking for clarification of its policy regarding human embryonic stem cell research  date there has been no response  continues to employ staff who are supportive of and in some cases involved with such research and refuses to publicly condemn such research  St Jude Children Research Hospital responds to our mailings and publicly professes its opposition to human embryonic stem cell research both in practice and theory this posting will continue to reflect a negative appraisal of their position  

In response to information received from an ALL supporter the following letter was sent to Judith Williams Black Director of Public Relations with St Jude Children Research Hospital   Jude Children Research Hospital

Memphis TN  Ms Williams Black an e dated November   you notified a supporter of American Life League  that St Jude does not currently do human embryonic stem cell research  are however protocols that involve hematopoietic  stem cell which are used for bone marrow transplants   in a job description for a post position available in the Department of Hematology at St Jude Children Research Hospital with Dr S McKinney the candidate is to  the molecular mechanisms regulating hematopoietic stem cell development from embryos and embryonic stem cells  underline added at American Life League would like to know exactly what the policy statement of St Jude Children Research Hospital is concerning human embryonic stem cell research prompt response to this inquiry is greatly appreciated Williams Black responded with a letter dated November   and wrote in part that the statement made in her e to our supporter  St Jude is not currently conducting human embryonic stem cell research  accurate Further Ms Williams Black pointed out that the job posting we referred to involved mouse embryos and use of mouse model systems  Williams Black concluded her letter by stating  should clarify our current involvement in embryonic stem cell research wrote to Ms Williams Black again on December   Ms Williams Black you for your letter dated November   responding to our inquiries about Shannon McKinney Ph and embryonic stem cell research your letter did not fully clarify St Jude Children Research Hospital position on human embryonic stem cell research repeatedly and consistently states that it is not currently conducting human embryonic stem cell research yet your department refuses to address the question of hospital staff who are known supporters of and participants in such research Further your response does not explain why SJCRH and its staff are conducting embryonic stem cell research on mouse models when this type of research is typically designed and pursued for applications to human beings McKinney is a former member  of the Public Education Committee of the International Society for Stem Cell Research  ISSCR publicly supports human embryonic stem cell research 

The following is taken from  Comments on NIH Draft Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Funding on May   welcome and applaud the leadership that the NIH proposes to assume for the oversight of human embryonic stem cell research in the United States The draft guidelines represent an important step towards accelerating critical medical research by giving scientists access to more embryonic stem cell lines that better reflect the diversity in our society make it possible to model inherited human diseases and have favorable properties such as reduced contamination with animal products Given the importance of human embryonic stem cell research to future medical progress access to an increased range of lines will accelerate efforts to understand and treat major public health problems International Society for Stem Cell Research  has already endorsed research on pluripotent stem cell lines derived via in vitro fertilization  somatic cell nuclear transfer  

parthenogenesis or gene reprogramming The ISSCR supports such stem cell research globally where performed under rigorous standards of research ethics described in the  ISSCR Guidelines for the Conduct of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research We reaffirm this position and encourage NIH to review its Guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research as the science in this area evolves In the interest of improving world health we urge the NIH to open discussions on funding research carried out with human pluripotent stem cell lines derived from sources other than excess reproductive IVF embryos including SCNT embryos if they become available and are derived under rigorous ethical standards McKinney has been involved in research utilizing human embryonic stem cells and cell lines and co an article entitled  Skin Cells Turned Into Stem Cells The collaborating authors include Jason West Susan Garfinkel Ph and Suzanne Kadereit Ph According to this article  current study directly fused adult skin cells with existing human embryonic stem cells so no human eggs were involved Although the fused cells still contained the genetic material or DNA from both of the two cells used  skin cells and embryonic stem cells they behaved very much like embryonic stem cells The fused cells could generate many different cell types of the body including brain cells hair cells skeletal muscle and intestine and also expressed many genes that are characteristic of embryonic stem cells 

While the job posting discussed earlier indicates that the research would be conducted on mice it is also obvious that clinical applications would be for human embryonic stem cells Dr McKinney writes a review to this point her work will enable human embryonic stem cell treatments   hematopoietic reconstitution from embryonic stem cells a sanguine future  Oliver Ph another staff member at SJCRH writes concerning retinal degeneration  human ocular diseases due to retinal degeneration lead to vision impairment and eventually blindness Recent advances using embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells suggest that one day cell therapy will be used to treat some of these diseases   http Peter Doherty another staff member was one of eighty Nobel laureates to sign a letter to President George W Bush in  urging funding for research on human embryos This letter was published in the Washington Post on February  

We at American Life League would like to ask the following of St Jude Children Research Hospital Does St Jude Children Research Hospital support human embryonic stem cell research or not such research is currently being conducted at any of its facilities If St Jude Children Research Hospital does not support human embryonic stem cell research why does the Hospital employ staff who are supporters of and participants in such research Will St Jude Children Research Hospital publicly state its unequivocal condemnation of human embryonic stem cell research and if so when last letter was again signed for however there has been no response

In February  American Life League learned that a member of the St Jude Children Research Hospital faculty Peter Doherty Ph was one of eighty Nobel laureates to sign a letter to President George W Bush in  urging funding for research on human embryos   letter was published in the Washington Post on February   letter states in part  the undersigned urge you to support Federal funding for research using human pluripotent stem cells Doherty signed his name and followed it with  Jude Children Research Hospital to reach Dr Doherty via the St Jude Children Research Hospital e were not answered Life League then mailed a letter to St Jude Children Research Hospital asking the following St Jude Children Research Hospital aware of Dr Doherty signing of the letter to President Bush in  letter was sent on February   via certified return receipt mail and was signed for by an employee of St Jude on February   St Jude has not responded to any of our questions from St Jude Children Research Hospital dated January  

Esther M Ashford Quality Assurance Representative Jude Children Research Hospital is not involved in any research or treatment involving human embryonic stem cells  of our treatment protocols for various cancers and other catastrophic diseases include the use of stem cell transplants but the stem cells used for these procedures are either harvested from adult or sibling donors or from the patient being treated  marrow peripheral blood and cord blood G Komen for the Cure

Komen for the Cure founder hosts fundraiser for top gay activist organization

Nancy Brinker the founder of the breast cancer research organization Komen for the Cure has thrown her weight behind another controversial cause gay activism Together with her son Eric Brinker hosted a reception for the gay legal advocacy organization Lambda Legal last month in Washington D Lambda is one of the leading organizations promoting the homosexual agenda in the country

Grants from the Susan G Komen Foundation for the Cure are flowing to Planned Parenthood as the women health organizations seek to rebuild their relationship after the controversy in February over the breast cancer charity unsuccessful attempt to defund Planned Parenthood

The Susan G Komen for the Cure Foundation has long upset pro advocates for denying the abortion cancer link and sending millions to the Planned Parenthood abortion business New information shows Komen also supporting centers engaging in embryonic stem cell research Karen Malec of the Coalition on Abortion Cancer has spent time examining Komen  Forms for the IRS for  and she found that Komen has active relationships with at least five research groups or educational facilities that engage in embryonic stem cell research which requires the destruction of unborn children in their earliest days for stem cells that have yet to help any patients

In a new interview with the Daily Caller Komen spokesman John Hammarley provided the latest figures showing the link between the two groups  confirmed  of Komen  affiliates have made donations to Planned Parenthood and last year those contributions totaled  million  much higher than the  Komen figures on its web site showed earlier this year

The Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation had noble beginnings launched by Nancy Goodman Brinker in response to a promise she made to her dying sister Susan Goodman Komen to do all she could to eradicate breast cancer  for years pro have opposed contributing to SGK because it not only denies that induced abortions may cause breast cancer it also bestows financial grants to Planned Parenthood affiliates SGK now has a webpage dedicated to defending its involvement with Planned Parenthood including message points and a letter from a  Catholic

Dr Tedd Collins has been the public face of an international campaign to help a Yale University hockey player suffering from leukemia to obtain a potentially life transplant

 gets me out of bed  Honestly this is very very important to me Collins said of his efforts to help Mandi Schwartz in a recent interview on ABC News

 as important as anything I ever done It really is he said

But now those efforts are under investigation by Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal It part of a growing pile of legal woes confronting the  immunologist

Late Friday Blumenthal sent Collins letters asking for the fundraising records of two charities the doctor established to help Schwartz and others like her

Blumenthal also directed the charities  Become My Hero and Natasha Place  to cease all fundraising until they register with the state saying it was  to solicit charitable funds in Connecticut until the organizations have made the appropriate filings required under the law

 will investigate to confirm that funds donated to these organizations promising to serve a significant charitable purpose have been used appropriately Blumenthal said in a statement

The attorney general acted after The New York Times disclosed a trail of lawsuits and fraud accusations against Collins from people across the U who claimed the doctor had duped them out of large amounts of money in investment ventures well before he created the Become My Hero and Natasha Place charities

In an e to ABC News Collins wrote that he had a  team looking over how Become My Hero and Natasha Place were set up He added that his lawyers would  able to provide a full accounting of the money and tell how things will be handled moving forward

 can accept that my past may hurt the image of our accomplishments I just want to have an opportunity to make sure that the things I created to save lives will not be injured because people doubt my ability to handle money What is created is far bigger than me he added

He did not respond to additional requests for comment

Mandi Schwartz was first diagnosed with leukemia in December  A successful stem transplant now represents her last best hope to survive

Teammates and friends have mounted a tireless effort across the Yale community the hockey world and beyond to find donors of bone marrow and umbilical blood in hopes of finding a perfect match It a search complicated by Mandi mixed Russian Ukrainian and German heritage which was chronicled by ABC News ESPN The New York Times and other media outlets

In an interview in June Collins said he became involved at the urging of his daughter Natasha a promising medical student at Yale as she was dying of leukemia last summer

 just looked at me and said  day dad maybe you can help me but hopefully you can help other people Collins said in the interview on ABC News  she told me about Mandi

He added  just like my daughter It really that simple  I don know God is really an amazing God I certain that he put her here for a reason and I have to think my daughter died for a reason to get through the day So maybe this is it

And so Collins created Become My Hero which helps patients find cord donors and Natasha Place which promotes awareness of how cord donation can help people of mixed heritage a group for whom bone matches are hard to find

Yale officials and members of the Schwartz family had suggested that people could help Mandi through Collins charities At the time they had no idea of his tangled financial past  dealings first disclosed by the New York Times four days ago

The Times reported that some of the allegations were so serious they were being investigated by the Secret Service and Internal Revenue Service A Secret Service official in Kentucky confirmed to ABC News that Collins was the subject of a fraud investigation there

Yale this week distanced itself from Collins removing references to the doctor and scrubbing any mention of his charities from stories on its Web site chronicling the fight to help Mandi Schwartz

Members of Mandi family said they received no money from Collins charities For them this has been an unwanted distraction They are focused on Mandi The  traveled to Seattle last week in preparation for a cord transplant which is now scheduled for Aug

Many savvy small businesses are affiliating themselves with charities to market their businesses Not only is it a primary means for developing a powerful network but also it helps others in the process People like to associate themselves with businesses that support causes which help disadvantaged people in a meaningful way

Don think that charities are oblivious to your motivations Most charities today understand your secondary purpose for participating in charities and are experienced at helping you receive a return on your charitable investments

Choosing a charity is sometimes confusing Each has its own demands on your time and a variety of different positions in which to contribute Look for charities that you believe in and to which you have some affinity Not only will it be more fun but also you be happier giving your time and means

From a business standpoint look for charities that will give you meaningful exposure to a large number of influential people In my corporate consulting days most of the partners sat on the boards of various charities with other business executives You also want to volunteer your time in a position that will show your talents and skills

If you are sponsoring a charitable event try to choose one in which your target market would participate For instance if you run a senior living community consider getting involved with charities for retired veterans If you manage a sporting goods store consider sponsoring a little league baseball team

Use Publicity to Associate Your Name With That Of the Charity

Linking your name with the charitable cause is an important part of charitable marketing Even if you are participating in a charity for altruistic reasons there no reason why you should not benefit from the resulting positive exposure Here are some ideas to maximize your exposure

 Publicize your donations of goods or services to charities by sending press releases and photos to the local media

 Include your charitable involvement in your marketing materials such as newsletters brochures signs displays advertisements and commercials

 Get involved with high causes that attract the media attention

 If you have given significant support to a program ask that it be named after you or the name of your business

 Give away information about your charity as a part of your business transactions such as placing pamphlets in your retail outlets having employees wear clothing or pins and buttons publicizing your charity or placing charity information with your product when it ships

 Lastly be sure to ask your charity to recognize your support in their publicity efforts

Market Your Products and Services To The Constituencies of Your Charity

Most charities have thousands even millions of people that either belong to the charity or who have some type of affinity with your charity These people make excellent prospects for your products or services because of your indirect association with them

Use these ideas to sell more of your products and services to your charity affinity group

 Direct market to the employees clients members family members and any group that is directly associated with your charity Make this group one of your niche markets by creating a marketing program tailored to their wants and needs

 Advertise your products and services in the communication vehicles of your charity such as newsletters and magazines

 Offer special discounts and targeted promotions to people who are associated with your charity

 Consider offering a percentage of the sale of particular products or services as a donation to your charitable cause

 Develop a  program or a  customer program or even a  club for constituents of your charitable cause by offering special benefits to members

Invite Your Charity to Market Your Products or Services

If you want to put your marketing in overdrive and multiply your charity marketing efforts consider inviting your charity to market for you in a way that you and your charity receive a significant benefit

Idea    Invite your charity members to sell coupons for your business and keep a percentage or the entire amount of the proceeds A good example of this would be to allow local high school band members to sell coupons to the neighborhood that you service Auto repair shops chiropractors beauty salons massage therapists fast food restaurants can all take advantage of this tactic

Idea    Designate specific products as  or  products that when sold financially benefit your charity Invite the charity to promote these products For instance if you own a barber shop a portion of the proceeds from all haircuts done on Tuesdays could go to your charity

Idea    Invite your charity to sell admission tickets to a special sale celebrity appearance or grand opening to build traffic for your business Allow the charity to keep all the proceeds while you benefit from the increased traffic

Idea    Create  during special times of the year such as Easter the Fourth of July or Memorial Day that can be donated to your charity or even sold to them at cost They in turn can resell the packages or you can sell the packages and give a percentage to your charity

Partner With A Charity to Target a Niche Market

Charities like businesses are interested in building their membership base The best way to do this is through marketing to specific niches that are inclined to develop an affinity with your charity Partnering with your charity to market to a niche will bring new customers to you and new members to your charity

For example suppose you owned a fitness center You could partner with a health related charity for senior adults by doing targeted promotions offering them free health classes in your fitness center Using your name and the name of your non charity in your promotion will lend credibility and breed trust in your offer

If you manage a financial planning firm you could partner with the American Association of Retired Persons and provide free tax consultations at the local library Or suppose you invented a product such as the mentholated candle  xxxxcandle You could partner with the local health clinic to jointly promote flu shots and your candle product

Taking the idea of charity partnerships a bit further you may consider establishing a full commercial venture with your charity Both parties would provide specific resources to run the venture For example you could provide the financial funding and the charity could provide the staff expertise and equipment

Although there are a lot of legal and tax issues to address with this strategy many such ventures are being established with success

Perhaps the biggest advantage from a business standpoint to be involved with a local charity is the opportunity you have to network with other like professionals If you are an independent professional such as a consultant C lawyer insurance agent etc this may be the primary source of business for your firm

Make sure you put your new friends on your networking list and make it a point to keep in close contact with them Send thank you cards meet for lunch make brief phone calls remember birthdays and include them in your newsletter to stay in touch

Make sure that you attend meetings and events where other professionals will be Volunteer to sit on boards or committees when time permits You might even consider urging your employees to become involved in charitable networking activities to extend their sphere of influence

Although this article has been about building your business through charities your primary motivation should be to help other people We should all leave this world a better place Hundreds of opportunities exist for you to make a difference in your society 

My wife and I are personally involved in a charity called Families Supporting Adoption We have two of the most beautiful children in the world that joined our family through the miracle of adoption We have started a non website for people who are involved in adoption to share their heartfelt stories of successful adoptions

When I was a college student I chaired the  From Santa program which sent gifts purchased by students to servicemen serving overseas I was once a young serviceman who served overseas during several holiday seasons and have experienced the loneliness of being away from my family It was my small way of giving something back

My wife and I have established our own little special charity for a family in Bolivia that has children with severe medical challenges Believe it or not our dollar goes a long way in a foreign country This one activity has been a great blessing to our family and theirs In fact we probably benefit from this charitable act more than our Bolivian family does

Everyone has a potential affinity with a charitable organization Search one out this holiday season and enjoy the sweet feelings you surely receive from helping someone else And don feel ashamed to profit from your charitable giving Hundreds of charities are searching for special businesses to help them in their cause Find them and lend your helping hand

Liz Scott Alex mother and co director of Alex Lemonade Stand Foundation stated in an e to ALL in May  that  Lemonade Stand Foundation has not funded anything even remotely related to embryonic stem cell research when it was pointed out to Mrs Scott that according to the Foundation website there were grant funds being directed toward researchers and research facilities that support promote and conduct such research she responded we have not issued a public policy position I can tell you that ALSF has always followed all federal guidelines for research that involves human cells and tissues We are very sensitive to the variety of opinions on issues related to stem cells and are committed to funding research programs that meet all of the stringent ethical standards at the institutional foundation and government levels that are designed to find cures for childhood cancer  can tell you that when we award funds to our grant recipients  of the funds are used for their project only institution is not allowed to take any indirect costs or general operating costs from the award funds or to use funds for other projects cautions that federal guidelines allow for both human embryonic stem cell research and the use of aborted fetal materials in research contacted  email in July  with an update request someone by the name of Lisa responded do not have a policy We have never received an application that includes embryonic stem cells so this isn an issue for us asked what the organization would do if it did receive a grant application that involved the use of human embryonic stem cells or aborted fetal material there was no further reply for Aging Research

The Alliance for Aging Research is a  group that advocates for medical research and scientific discoveries to improve the health and independence of Americans as they age  such the Alliance supports public policies that advance research involving both adult and embryonic stem cells and regenerative medicine in general the Alliance for Aging Research opposes efforts to copy human life through cloning technologies it is a leader among patient groups and science advocates supporting public funding for broad activities in stem cell research as well as therapeutic cloning of compatible stem cell lines for research and potential therapies On its own and through membership in the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research the Alliance will support the enactment of legislation to encourage increased federal funding for advances in stem cell research

 Alliance for Regenerative Medicine  mission is to advance regenerative medicine by representing supporting and engaging all stakeholders in the field including companies academic research institutions patient advocacy groups foundations health insurers financial institutions and other organizations to the website regenerative medicine includes cell therapies gene therapy biologics tissue engineering bio and stem cells for drug discovery toxicity testing and disease modeling It is this last branch of regenerative medicine which causes the most concern  are increasingly learning to leverage the use of stem cells and living tissue constructs to create in vitro models to study human mechanisms of disease and the effects of drugs on a variety of cell and tissue types such as human heart liver and brain cells These models built predominantly using embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells allow for faster and safer drug development

In an email to ALL from Carrie Munk at the ALS Association July   ALS Association primarily funds adult stem cell research  The Association is funding one study using embryonic stem cells  and the stem cell line was established many years ago under ethical guidelines set by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  this research is funded by one specific donor who is committed to this area of research  fact donors may stipulate that their funds not be invested in this study or any stem cell project Under very strict guidelines The Association may fund embryonic stem cell research in the future ALS Association also financially supports NEALS  Northeast ALS Consortium which performs human embryonic stem cell research ALS Association Awards  to the NEALS Consortium for Its TREAT ALS Clinical Trials Network

For the sixth consecutive year The ALS Association is pleased to announce its support of the Northeast ALS Consortium  the largest consortium of ALS clinical researchers in the world This year award totals  and will fund new initiatives and ongoing programs that will increase the quality and efficiency of clinical trials for ALS  Northeast ALS Consortium  is an international independent non group of researchers who collaboratively conduct clinical research in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  and other motor neuron diseases utilizing the spinal cord neural stem cells from electively aborted fetus Association

 Alzheimer Association policy supports and encourages any legitimate scientific avenue that offers the potential to advance this goal including human embryonic stem cell research and we oppose any restriction or limitation on research provided that appropriate scientific review and ethical and oversight guidelines and compliance are in place

The American Cancer Society is not considered a pro organization for the following reasons for human embryonic stem cell researchThe American Cancer Society  has for many years insisted that the federal government  the institution best suited to both fund and oversee research using human embryonic stem cells while claiming to fund only  into uses of human adult stem cells and stem cells from umbilical cord blood in August  when then Bush signed an executive order restricting federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to stem cell lines that were already in existence at the time the ACS issued a statement commending the administration for allowing stem cell research to proceed and expressed hope for its future Society believes that such research holds extraordinary potential in the fight against a variety of life diseases currently afflicting an estimated  million Americans the statement said It continued  American Cancer Society commends the Administration for allowing this vital scientific research to proceed in a limited way American Cancer Society remains hopeful that both the government and commercial sectors will continue to work collaboratively and with an open mind to explore additional solutions that will allow for the continuation of human embryonic stem cell research as necessary and appropriate the ACS statement concluded statements can no longer be found on the ACS website but can be viewed here

The American Council on Science and Health  is a consumer education consortium concerned with issues related to food nutrition chemicals pharmaceuticals lifestyle the environment and health  was founded in  by a group of scientists who had become concerned that many important public policies related to health and the environment did not have a sound scientific basis These scientists created the organization to add reason and balance to debates about public health issues and to bring common sense views to the public

We strongly support the protection and expansion of all forms of stem cell research which offer great hope for a cure and better treatments for diabetes We support legislation and proposals that enhance funding for stem cell research at the federal and state levels

The American Heart Association website states the following regarding stem cell research Cell Research

The American Heart Association funds meritorious research involving human adult stem cells  because it helps us fight heart disease and stroke We don fund research involving stem cells derived from human embryos or fetal tissue

However it continues adult stem cells into a pluripotent state may lead to patient cell therapies that could reduce many of the underlying complications in therapies with embryonic stem cells important for research to continue in both cell types To know how induced adult stem cells need to perform we must know more about the innate function of embryonic stem cells

The American Lung Association recognizes that research with human stem cells offer significant potential to further our understanding of fundamental lung biology and to develop cell therapies to treat lung disease The American Lung Association supports the responsible pursuit of research involving the use of human stem cells

 principles of medical ethics of the AMA do not prohibit a physician from performing an abortion in accordance with good medical practice and under circumstances that do not violate the law

 were very pleased on September   that the DC Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay of the preliminary injunction pending its review of the appeal of the judicial challenge to federal funding for human embryonic stem cell  research Without getting mired down in all the various terms and courts what this means is that federal funding for hESC research will continue at least for the time period that it takes for the Court of Appeals to review Judge Lamberth August  decision to enjoin funding  should also know that yesterday the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research  of which PAN is a founding member filed an amicus brief in the District Court  brief supports and compliments the Department of Justice  brief that was filed on behalf of the National Institutes of Health  on Monday of Veteran Affairs and APDA Winter  Parkinson Press Newsletter

A report issued from the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in December of  caused concerns that the organization may start advocating for abortion rights a section of the report on human rights IFRC quotes a widely criticized document issued by Anand Grover the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health which said must take measures to ensure that legal and safe abortion services are available accessible and of good quality The IFRC report goes on to editorialize  the real challenge is to find out how many states will indeed change their policies accordingly may lead some to believe IFRC could eventually declare abortion a human right as Amnesty International did in  Amid much controversy Amnesty International simply announced that endorsing abortion as a right was a  outgrowth of its  campaign countering violence against women

The American Thoracic Society  is an organization dedicated to serving patients with lung disease through research advocacy training and patient care As such it supports making federal funding available for research using human embryonic stem cells with appropriate guidelines and federal and institutional oversight    stem cell research approaches should neither distract from nor preempt research for which the goal is to assess the use of pluripotent embryonic stem cells for the treatment of lung diseases

Amnesty International defends access to abortion for women at risk

In April  Amnesty International changed its neutral stance on abortion to supporting access to abortion in cases of rape and incest and when the life or the health of the mother might be threatened Amnesty official policy is that they  not promote abortion as a universal right but  the decriminalisation of abortion

Amnesty International a human rights organization that used to be abortion neutral is now using the problem of maternal mortality to advocate for abortion In a new report ostensibly on medical care for maternal health Amnesty calls on governments to repeal abortion laws and conscience protection for medical workers who may object They also call for public health systems to train and equip health care providers to perform abortions  Health is a Human Right campaign focuses attention on four countries Sierra Leone Burkina Faso Peru and the United States Amnesty argues that maternal mortality will decrease if it is treated as a human rights issue if costs to health care are covered by governments and if a right for women to control their reproductive and sex lives is established

 little brain tumor research utilizes embryonic stem cells  being said there are some federally approved cell lines that researchers do use to understand how brain tumors evolve Brains develop until a person mid and it is believed that many brain tumors evolve during that development process  hope is that if we can determine the origin of brain tumor development than we can turn off that pathway cell gene etc    NBTS is committed to funding and supporting any research that may lead to improved therapies for our brain tumor patients Treadwell

 National Breast Cancer Foundation mission is to save lives through early detection and to provide mammograms for those in need Our mission includes increasing awareness through education providing diagnostic breast care services for those in need and providing nurturing support services NBCF partners  medical facilities across the country to provide free mammograms and diagnostic breast care services to underserved women We require that medical facilities within our network have the capacity to continue treatment after an abnormal finding or diagnosis of breast cancer we do not find any link between the NBCF and Planned Parenthood or human embryonic stem cell research we are disappointed to find that the NBCF neglects to make a bold and public statement condemning either one the NBCF website fails to fully educate visitors on the documented links between oral contraceptive use and prior induced abortions and future risk for breast cancer  its FAQ section the NBCF notes that there is an increased risk of breast cancer for women who have been using birth control pills for more than five years but goes on to say that the risk is small  also notes that Hormone Replacement Therapy  is definitely a risk factor and that HRT was determined to be a carcinogen by the American Cancer Society in the early   the NBCF fails to inform readers that combined oral contraceptives contain the same drugs as combined hormone replacement therapy and that both oral contraceptives and HRT were classified as Class  carcinogens by the World Health Organization  in   Children Leukemia Foundation Avenue U

The NCLF Research Center is staffed by leading scientists in the fields of molecular biology stem cell biology hematology and oncology who work collaboratively to advance knowledge and develop innovative treatment technologies  current focus is studying the relationship between cancer cells and adult  cells the results of which will impact both current clinical practice and the future design of cancer therapies In particular we believe our efforts will lead to the development of new therapeutic schemes for AML  myeloid leukemia a particularly rare and aggressive form of leukemia using Adult Stem Cells Stem cell research represents the cutting edge of cancer research today All NCLF research is conducted using stem cells from adult donors or stem cells extracted from the umbilical cord or placenta after birth  NCLF does NOT use embryonic stem cells in its research we use Adult Stem Cells  a result of legislation signed in  almost all cancer research involving embryonic stem cells in the past decade has been conducted using only  cell lines with only  sets of genes mutations and characteristics  While these  cell lines have been useful in gathering basic information  cannot provide researchers with the necessary information for understanding and treating diseases To conduct valuable research a much larger sample size is required  stem cells voluntarily donated by adult donors or extracted from the umbilical cord or placenta after birth do not require the destruction of an embryo and  greater variability   embryonic stem cells that are  to form tumors or be rejected by recipents because of their  foreign status adult stem cells are relatively easy to collect and rarely cause rejection Kidney Foundation

The National Kidney Foundation did not respond to ALL questionnaire on the life issues but did send a letter to our independent researcher stating that  the present time we do not have any policies on the above mentioned subjects  human embryonic stem cell research and research involving aborted fetal body parts did not find any information on the organization website that would contradict this statement Multiple Sclerosis Society

 National Multiple Sclerosis Society supports the conduct of scientifically meritorious medical research including research using human cells in accordance with federal state and local laws and with adherence to the strictest ethical and procedural guidelines Society believes that all promising avenues that could lead to the cure or prevention of MS or relieve its most devastating symptoms by repairing MS damage must be explored expanding the stem cell lines that are available for federally funded research remedy the flaws in the current federal policy the Society supports legislation that would increase the number of approved embryonic stem cell lines that can be used in federally funded research by allowing new lines to be generated from embryos that have been donated for research purposes by people using the services of in vitro fertilization clinics Veterans of America

A friend of American Life League emailed PPMD through the website contact form and asked is Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy policy regarding human embryonic stem cell research  could you please provide a simple yes or no answer to this question  PPMD fund or support human embryonic stem cell research  explaination that requires paragraphs tends to obscure the question  asked this question a few years ago but technology advances and policies change so I felt it necessary to ask again from PPMD answered as follows we don  a policy regarding human embryonic stem cell research  actually don have a specific policy that forbids it but we are not actively seeking projects in that area and technology has advanced to the point where there is no need to use cells from embryos We can take skin cells from consenting adults and convert them to a state that is almost like an embryonic stem cell and go from there  added of Promise

The website for the International Office of the Salvation Army  states the following Salvation Army believes all people are created in the image of God and therefore have unique and intrinsic value Human life is sacred and all people should be treated with dignity and respect The Salvation Army accepts the moment of fertilisation as the start of human life We believe that society has a responsibility to care for others and especially to protect and promote the welfare of vulnerable people including unborn children Salvation Army believes that life is a gift from God and we are answerable to God for the taking of life As such The Salvation Army is concerned about the growing ready acceptance of abortion which reflects insufficient concern for vulnerable persons including the unborn We do not believe that genetic abnormalities that are identified in an unborn child who is likely to live longer than a brief period after birth are sufficient to warrant a termination of pregnancy Salvation Army recognizes tragic and perplexing circumstances that require difficult decisions regarding a pregnancy Decisions should be made only after prayerful and thoughtful consideration acknowledging the tremendous pressures that occur during an unexpected pregnancy There is a responsibility on all involved to give the parents of the unborn child particularly the woman appropriate pastoral medical and other counsel The Salvation Army believes that termination can occur only whenIn addition rape and incest are brutal acts of dominance violating women physically and emotionally This situation represents a special case for the consideration of termination as the violation may be compounded by the continuation of the pregnancy FROM ALL A reading of the Salvation Army position makes it clear that it does support abortion  in the cases of  of the mother and  deformity  as well as some cases of rape and incest  Salvation Army also supports abortifacient birth control Choice Pharmaceutical Institute

St Baldrick Foundation funds cannot be used for human embryonic stem cell research This is not a statement on whether or not we think it should be supported the decision is based on the fact that many of our donors and volunteers  our source of funds  would not be comfortable supporting it Stem cell transplantations not using human embryonic stem cells  using cord blood or matched donors  are often used in treating childhood cancer patients and our funds may be used in this non area of research

The following information is lengthy however it boils down to the fact that there are doctors on staff at St Jude Children Research Hospital who are either supportive of or involved in human embryonic stem cell research and SJCRH refuses to reply to ALL written correspondence concerning these staff  Jude Children Research Hospital has not publicly stated an unequivocal condemnation of anti research practices and ALL will continue to give this organization a negative rating on this website until it does  

A review of the St Jude Children Research Hospital website indicates that the three doctors referred to in correspondence below are still on staff at the facility  appears also that each continues to be involved in and supportive of human embryonic stem cell research particularly Dr S McKinney who co additional scientifc research papers in  with Dr George Daley who has been involved in iPS stem cell research further correspondence has been received from SJCRH and no publicly stated unequivocal condemnation of human embryonic stem cell research has come from St Jude Children Research Hospital  

ALL has on more than one occasion written to St Jude Children Research Hospital via certified letter  have been signed for asking for clarification of its policy regarding human embryonic stem cell research  date there has been no response  continues to employ staff who are supportive of and in some cases involved with such research and refuses to publicly condemn such research  St Jude Children Research Hospital responds to our mailings and publicly professes its opposition to human embryonic stem cell research both in practice and theory this posting will continue to reflect a negative appraisal of their position  

In response to information received from an ALL supporter the following letter was sent to Judith Williams Black Director of Public Relations with St Jude Children Research Hospital   Jude Children Research Hospital

Memphis TN  Ms Williams Black an e dated November   you notified a supporter of American Life League  that St Jude does not currently do human embryonic stem cell research  are however protocols that involve hematopoietic  stem cell which are used for bone marrow transplants   in a job description for a post position available in the Department of Hematology at St Jude Children Research Hospital with Dr S McKinney the candidate is to  the molecular mechanisms regulating hematopoietic stem cell development from embryos and embryonic stem cells  underline added at American Life League would like to know exactly what the policy statement of St Jude Children Research Hospital is concerning human embryonic stem cell research prompt response to this inquiry is greatly appreciated Williams Black responded with a letter dated November   and wrote in part that the statement made in her e to our supporter  St Jude is not currently conducting human embryonic stem cell research  accurate Further Ms Williams Black pointed out that the job posting we referred to involved mouse embryos and use of mouse model systems  Williams Black concluded her letter by stating  should clarify our current involvement in embryonic stem cell research wrote to Ms Williams Black again on December   Ms Williams Black you for your letter dated November   responding to our inquiries about Shannon McKinney Ph and embryonic stem cell research your letter did not fully clarify St Jude Children Research Hospital position on human embryonic stem cell research repeatedly and consistently states that it is not currently conducting human embryonic stem cell research yet your department refuses to address the question of hospital staff who are known supporters of and participants in such research Further your response does not explain why SJCRH and its staff are conducting embryonic stem cell research on mouse models when this type of research is typically designed and pursued for applications to human beings McKinney is a former member  of the Public Education Committee of the International Society for Stem Cell Research  ISSCR publicly supports human embryonic stem cell research 

The following is taken from  Comments on NIH Draft Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Funding on May   welcome and applaud the leadership that the NIH proposes to assume for the oversight of human embryonic stem cell research in the United States The draft guidelines represent an important step towards accelerating critical medical research by giving scientists access to more embryonic stem cell lines that better reflect the diversity in our society make it possible to model inherited human diseases and have favorable properties such as reduced contamination with animal products Given the importance of human embryonic stem cell research to future medical progress access to an increased range of lines will accelerate efforts to understand and treat major public health problems International Society for Stem Cell Research  has already endorsed research on pluripotent stem cell lines derived via in vitro fertilization  somatic cell nuclear transfer  

parthenogenesis or gene reprogramming The ISSCR supports such stem cell research globally where performed under rigorous standards of research ethics described in the  ISSCR Guidelines for the Conduct of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research We reaffirm this position and encourage NIH to review its Guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research as the science in this area evolves In the interest of improving world health we urge the NIH to open discussions on funding research carried out with human pluripotent stem cell lines derived from sources other than excess reproductive IVF embryos including SCNT embryos if they become available and are derived under rigorous ethical standards McKinney has been involved in research utilizing human embryonic stem cells and cell lines and co an article entitled  Skin Cells Turned Into Stem Cells The collaborating authors include Jason West Susan Garfinkel Ph and Suzanne Kadereit Ph According to this article  current study directly fused adult skin cells with existing human embryonic stem cells so no human eggs were involved Although the fused cells still contained the genetic material or DNA from both of the two cells used  skin cells and embryonic stem cells they behaved very much like embryonic stem cells The fused cells could generate many different cell types of the body including brain cells hair cells skeletal muscle and intestine and also expressed many genes that are characteristic of embryonic stem cells 

While the job posting discussed earlier indicates that the research would be conducted on mice it is also obvious that clinical applications would be for human embryonic stem cells Dr McKinney writes a review to this point her work will enable human embryonic stem cell treatments   hematopoietic reconstitution from embryonic stem cells a sanguine future  Oliver Ph another staff member at SJCRH writes concerning retinal degeneration  human ocular diseases due to retinal degeneration lead to vision impairment and eventually blindness Recent advances using embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells suggest that one day cell therapy will be used to treat some of these diseases   http Peter Doherty another staff member was one of eighty Nobel laureates to sign a letter to President George W Bush in  urging funding for research on human embryos This letter was published in the Washington Post on February  

We at American Life League would like to ask the following of St Jude Children Research Hospital Does St Jude Children Research Hospital support human embryonic stem cell research or not such research is currently being conducted at any of its facilities If St Jude Children Research Hospital does not support human embryonic stem cell research why does the Hospital employ staff who are supporters of and participants in such research Will St Jude Children Research Hospital publicly state its unequivocal condemnation of human embryonic stem cell research and if so when last letter was again signed for however there has been no response

In February  American Life League learned that a member of the St Jude Children Research Hospital faculty Peter Doherty Ph was one of eighty Nobel laureates to sign a letter to President George W Bush in  urging funding for research on human embryos   letter was published in the Washington Post on February   letter states in part  the undersigned urge you to support Federal funding for research using human pluripotent stem cells Doherty signed his name and followed it with  Jude Children Research Hospital to reach Dr Doherty via the St Jude Children Research Hospital e were not answered Life League then mailed a letter to St Jude Children Research Hospital asking the following St Jude Children Research Hospital aware of Dr Doherty signing of the letter to President Bush in  letter was sent on February   via certified return receipt mail and was signed for by an employee of St Jude on February   St Jude has not responded to any of our questions from St Jude Children Research Hospital dated January  

Esther M Ashford Quality Assurance Representative Jude Children Research Hospital is not involved in any research or treatment involving human embryonic stem cells  of our treatment protocols for various cancers and other catastrophic diseases include the use of stem cell transplants but the stem cells used for these procedures are either harvested from adult or sibling donors or from the patient being treated  marrow peripheral blood and cord blood G Komen for the Cure

The Susan G Komen for the Cure Foundation has long upset pro advocates for denying the abortion cancer link and sending millions to the Planned Parenthood abortion business New information shows Komen also supporting centers engaging in embryonic stem cell research Karen Malec of the Coalition on Abortion Cancer has spent time examining Komen  Forms for the IRS for  and she found that Komen has active relationships with at least five research groups or educational facilities that engage in embryonic stem cell research which requires the destruction of unborn children in their earliest days for stem cells that have yet to help any patients

In a new interview with the Daily Caller Komen spokesman John Hammarley provided the latest figures showing the link between the two groups  confirmed  of Komen  affiliates have made donations to Planned Parenthood and last year those contributions totaled  million  much higher than the  Komen figures on its web site showed earlier this year

The Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation had noble beginnings launched by Nancy Goodman Brinker in response to a promise she made to her dying sister Susan Goodman Komen to do all she could to eradicate breast cancer  for years pro have opposed contributing to SGK because it not only denies that induced abortions may cause breast cancer it also bestows financial grants to Planned Parenthood affiliates SGK now has a webpage dedicated to defending its involvement with Planned Parenthood including message points and a letter from a  Catholic

The end of the year is the time to consider wrapping up your charitable donations to qualify for the current year tax deduction and there no quicker way to donate than with a credit card

 gifts of cash  includes gifts made by check credit card or payroll deductions are the easiest say tax experts at the accounting firm Grant Thornton in the company  Year End Tax Guide The key is to make sure you substantiate them  donations of  or more must be substantiated by 

the charity Under  a canceled check or credit card receipt is 

For the purposes of your return the Internal Revenue Service considers credit card donations the same as cash contributions which are the simplest deductions to claim on your return You may save more in taxes by donating property instead but the rules for donating property  and claiming it on your return  are more complicated  

According to Grant Thornton if you contribute to charities by check those donations can be deducted in the year they are mailed Contributions by credit card are valid the year the charge happened and pledges cannot be deducted until the payment is accepted That makes cards ideal for last donations If you away from stamps but near your wallet and a computer you can make a donation by credit card

If your tax situation and your heart dictate that you want to donate this year most charitable agencies large and small heartily accept credit card donations Large charities and small have expanded their humanitarian reach by letting 

supporters make pledges through one or monthly payments charged 

Depending on the type of card you can also earn airline miles cash back and other rewards that you can either enjoy yourself or donate to family friends or a charity Donations of airline miles are typically not considered tax deductible but cash donations are says the IRS 

You can also use your regular card to donate to a variety of charities but some issuers have created credit cards to support specific charitable organizations

Finally some credit cards have set up onlline portals that encourage you to  to charity One No Hassle Giving Discover

all let you select from a vetted group of charities and then make a quick donation If you donate through Capital One site it absorbs the transaction fee so  percent of your donation goes to the charity Discover and American Express use a third party JustGive to process donations and deduct a  percent transaction fee from the donation

One important warning about credit cards and charities If you notice a small charge on your credit card statement from a charity that you do not remember donating to it should be a red flag The dollar donation fraud works like this When scammers steal someone credit card numbers they will donate  to a charity via the card to make sure that it is still valid They hope cardholders will shrug off the charge and not question its origin If you see that type of charge on your bill it is a sign that your credit card number could be in the wrong hands If that the case call the issuer immediately and cut off the thief access to your money You may be charitable but probably you aren that charitable

Many savvy small businesses are affiliating themselves with charities to market their businesses Not only is it a primary means for developing a powerful network but also it helps others in the process People like to associate themselves with businesses that support causes which help disadvantaged people in a meaningful way

Don think that charities are oblivious to your motivations Most charities today understand your secondary purpose for participating in charities and are experienced at helping you receive a return on your charitable investments

Choosing a charity is sometimes confusing Each has its own demands on your time and a variety of different positions in which to contribute Look for charities that you believe in and to which you have some affinity Not only will it be more fun but also you be happier giving your time and means

From a business standpoint look for charities that will give you meaningful exposure to a large number of influential people In my corporate consulting days most of the partners sat on the boards of various charities with other business executives You also want to volunteer your time in a position that will show your talents and skills

If you are sponsoring a charitable event try to choose one in which your target market would participate For instance if you run a senior living community consider getting involved with charities for retired veterans If you manage a sporting goods store consider sponsoring a little league baseball team

Use Publicity to Associate Your Name With That Of the Charity

Linking your name with the charitable cause is an important part of charitable marketing Even if you are participating in a charity for altruistic reasons there no reason why you should not benefit from the resulting positive exposure Here are some ideas to maximize your exposure

 Publicize your donations of goods or services to charities by sending press releases and photos to the local media

 Include your charitable involvement in your marketing materials such as newsletters brochures signs displays advertisements and commercials

 Get involved with high causes that attract the media attention

 If you have given significant support to a program ask that it be named after you or the name of your business

 Give away information about your charity as a part of your business transactions such as placing pamphlets in your retail outlets having employees wear clothing or pins and buttons publicizing your charity or placing charity information with your product when it ships

 Lastly be sure to ask your charity to recognize your support in their publicity efforts

Market Your Products and Services To The Constituencies of Your Charity

Most charities have thousands even millions of people that either belong to the charity or who have some type of affinity with your charity These people make excellent prospects for your products or services because of your indirect association with them

Use these ideas to sell more of your products and services to your charity affinity group

 Direct market to the employees clients members family members and any group that is directly associated with your charity Make this group one of your niche markets by creating a marketing program tailored to their wants and needs

 Advertise your products and services in the communication vehicles of your charity such as newsletters and magazines

 Offer special discounts and targeted promotions to people who are associated with your charity

 Consider offering a percentage of the sale of particular products or services as a donation to your charitable cause

 Develop a  program or a  customer program or even a  club for constituents of your charitable cause by offering special benefits to members

Invite Your Charity to Market Your Products or Services

If you want to put your marketing in overdrive and multiply your charity marketing efforts consider inviting your charity to market for you in a way that you and your charity receive a significant benefit

Idea    Invite your charity members to sell coupons for your business and keep a percentage or the entire amount of the proceeds A good example of this would be to allow local high school band members to sell coupons to the neighborhood that you service Auto repair shops chiropractors beauty salons massage therapists fast food restaurants can all take advantage of this tactic

Idea    Designate specific products as  or  products that when sold financially benefit your charity Invite the charity to promote these products For instance if you own a barber shop a portion of the proceeds from all haircuts done on Tuesdays could go to your charity

Idea    Invite your charity to sell admission tickets to a special sale celebrity appearance or grand opening to build traffic for your business Allow the charity to keep all the proceeds while you benefit from the increased traffic

Idea    Create  during special times of the year such as Easter the Fourth of July or Memorial Day that can be donated to your charity or even sold to them at cost They in turn can resell the packages or you can sell the packages and give a percentage to your charity

Partner With A Charity to Target a Niche Market

Charities like businesses are interested in building their membership base The best way to do this is through marketing to specific niches that are inclined to develop an affinity with your charity Partnering with your charity to market to a niche will bring new customers to you and new members to your charity

For example suppose you owned a fitness center You could partner with a health related charity for senior adults by doing targeted promotions offering them free health classes in your fitness center Using your name and the name of your non charity in your promotion will lend credibility and breed trust in your offer

If you manage a financial planning firm you could partner with the American Association of Retired Persons and provide free tax consultations at the local library Or suppose you invented a product such as the mentholated candle  xxxxcandle You could partner with the local health clinic to jointly promote flu shots and your candle product

Taking the idea of charity partnerships a bit further you may consider establishing a full commercial venture with your charity Both parties would provide specific resources to run the venture For example you could provide the financial funding and the charity could provide the staff expertise and equipment

Although there are a lot of legal and tax issues to address with this strategy many such ventures are being established with success

Perhaps the biggest advantage from a business standpoint to be involved with a local charity is the opportunity you have to network with other like professionals If you are an independent professional such as a consultant C lawyer insurance agent etc this may be the primary source of business for your firm

Make sure you put your new friends on your networking list and make it a point to keep in close contact with them Send thank you cards meet for lunch make brief phone calls remember birthdays and include them in your newsletter to stay in touch

Make sure that you attend meetings and events where other professionals will be Volunteer to sit on boards or committees when time permits You might even consider urging your employees to become involved in charitable networking activities to extend their sphere of influence

Although this article has been about building your business through charities your primary motivation should be to help other people We should all leave this world a better place Hundreds of opportunities exist for you to make a difference in your society 

My wife and I are personally involved in a charity called Families Supporting Adoption We have two of the most beautiful children in the world that joined our family through the miracle of adoption We have started a non website for people who are involved in adoption to share their heartfelt stories of successful adoptions

When I was a college student I chaired the  From Santa program which sent gifts purchased by students to servicemen serving overseas I was once a young serviceman who served overseas during several holiday seasons and have experienced the loneliness of being away from my family It was my small way of giving something back

My wife and I have established our own little special charity for a family in Bolivia that has children with severe medical challenges Believe it or not our dollar goes a long way in a foreign country This one activity has been a great blessing to our family and theirs In fact we probably benefit from this charitable act more than our Bolivian family does

Everyone has a potential affinity with a charitable organization Search one out this holiday season and enjoy the sweet feelings you surely receive from helping someone else And don feel ashamed to profit from your charitable giving Hundreds of charities are searching for special businesses to help them in their cause Find them and lend your helping hand

The end of the year is the time to consider wrapping up your charitable donations to qualify for the current year tax deduction and there no quicker way to donate than with a credit card

 gifts of cash  includes gifts made by check credit card or payroll deductions are the easiest say tax experts at the accounting firm Grant Thornton in the company  Year End Tax Guide The key is to make sure you substantiate them  donations of  or more must be substantiated by 

the charity Under  a canceled check or credit card receipt is 

For the purposes of your return the Internal Revenue Service considers credit card donations the same as cash contributions which are the simplest deductions to claim on your return You may save more in taxes by donating property instead but the rules for donating property  and claiming it on your return  are more complicated  

According to Grant Thornton if you contribute to charities by check those donations can be deducted in the year they are mailed Contributions by credit card are valid the year the charge happened and pledges cannot be deducted until the payment is accepted That makes cards ideal for last donations If you away from stamps but near your wallet and a computer you can make a donation by credit card

If your tax situation and your heart dictate that you want to donate this year most charitable agencies large and small heartily accept credit card donations Large charities and small have expanded their humanitarian reach by letting 

supporters make pledges through one or monthly payments charged 

Depending on the type of card you can also earn airline miles cash back and other rewards that you can either enjoy yourself or donate to family friends or a charity Donations of airline miles are typically not considered tax deductible but cash donations are says the IRS 

You can also use your regular card to donate to a variety of charities but some issuers have created credit cards to support specific charitable organizations

Finally some credit cards have set up onlline portals that encourage you to  to charity One No Hassle Giving Discover

all let you select from a vetted group of charities and then make a quick donation If you donate through Capital One site it absorbs the transaction fee so  percent of your donation goes to the charity Discover and American Express use a third party JustGive to process donations and deduct a  percent transaction fee from the donation

One important warning about credit cards and charities If you notice a small charge on your credit card statement from a charity that you do not remember donating to it should be a red flag The dollar donation fraud works like this When scammers steal someone credit card numbers they will donate  to a charity via the card to make sure that it is still valid They hope cardholders will shrug off the charge and not question its origin If you see that type of charge on your bill it is a sign that your credit card number could be in the wrong hands If that the case call the issuer immediately and cut off the thief access to your money You may be charitable but probably you aren that charitable
