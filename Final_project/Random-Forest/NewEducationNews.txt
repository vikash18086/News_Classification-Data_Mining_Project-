Smile Foundation is a national level development organisation directly benefitting over  children and their families every year through  welfare projects on education healthcare livelihood and women empowerment in more than  remote villages and slums across  states of India

Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life the means because it empowers an individual to earn his livelihood and the end because it increases one awareness on a range of issues  from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one rights  and in the process help him evolve as a better citizen

Doubtless education is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation But child education cannot be done in isolation A child will go to school only if the family particularly the mother is assured of healthcare and empowered Moreover when an elder sibling is relevantly skilled to be employable and begins earning the journey of empowerment continues beyond the present generation

Realizing this Smile Foundation beginning in the corridors of education adopted a lifecycle approach of development focusing its interventions on children their families and the larger community

Smile Foundation believes that unless members of the civil society are involved proactively in the process of development sustainable change will not happen Following this model of Civic Driven Change Smile Foundation sensitizes and engages the civil society making it an active partner in all its welfare initiatives

Today  million children in India are out of school  surrounded by poverty illness and despair they are fighting a daily battle for their survival Together we can bring hope in their lives Together we can bring change and make it last

 youth to receive training at  new STeP centres 

A new window of opportunity opened for  young men and women from slums of Delhi Chennai Bengaluru Kolkata Mumbai and Gurgaon with the launch of  new Smile Twin e Programme  centres 

While metropolitan cities offer a plethora of career choices and lucrative job options to youth those from the socio marginalized segments of society are often left out 

As children these youth could not complete their education because of extreme conditions at home Later they could not get a decent job because of lack of the required skill set Many of them would have ended up continuing with their parents profession mostly labour work or low paid temporary jobs without ever hoping for even basic financial and social security and their children would have probably shared a similar fate 

Smile Foundations STeP programme is an attempt to break this cycle at an early stage The programme enrols urban underprivileged youth and trains them in market oriented job skills such as computers communication retail management marketing and personality development These youth are then placed in reputed brands from the retail and service sector finally stepping towards a dignified and independent livelihood

Mothers cherish the joy of learning in Guna MP

More than  mothers have begun to cherish the joy of learning at Adult Education Centres established under the Integrated Education and Health programme in Guna district in Madhya Pradesh These women who had never been to school before were inspired to learn by their children who are regular students at our Mission Education centres

To help them enter and stay in the fold of education the teachers are regularly counselling the parents and conducting door to door visits 

The home visits are focused on encouraging the parents to get involved with the learning process and holistic development of their children They are also motivated to visit the centre from time to time and share their feedback and ideas

Mon After stringent objections from several private schools to a proposed scheme to offer free education from Class VI  Class XII to girls from single child families the Central Board for Secondary Education has allowed them to offer the fee waiver from Class XI upwards Private schools across the country have forced the Indian government to water down a proposed initiative to boost gender parity in education and improve the status of the girl child in India thus curbing female foeticide and infanticide and improving a skewed countrywide child sex ratio   

Last year the Human Resource Development ministry had announced a scheme 

waiving fees from Class VI to XII for girl children from single child families But a section of private educational institutions did not want to exempt girls from the fees for fear of losing revenue 

Now the Central Board of Secondary Education  has now offered them a way out In a circular issued on March   the CBSE has listed two sets of guidelines on the issue  one for the government Kendriya Vidyalayas and the other for private schools

The Kendriya Vidyalayas according to the circular will have to follow the government policy in toto but a concession has been granted to private institutions  the Kendriya Vidyalayas would continue to give fee waiver to single girl children  meals and transportation fees from Class VI to XII as per the scheme already introduced by the board the CBSE said 

The same is not applicable to private players  private independent schools affiliated to the CBSE may also consider extending waiver of school fee  meals and transportation fee to single girl children studying in Classes IX to XII the circular said

This means the private schools have been exempted from the fee waiver scheme for three years  from Class VI to VIII

The CBSE earlier circular issued on October   immediately after the ministry announcement had asked all schools regardless of their private or state status to implement the scheme 

The circular is advisory in nature but all institutions are expected to follow it 

One of the main objectives behind the scheme is to improve the status of the girl child and women particularly in view of rampant female foeticide in the affluent states of north India such as Punjab Haryana and Delhi 

Several private schools however showed little enthusiasm for this Carmel Convent a well school in the capital filed a case in the Delhi High Court challenging the CBSE circular The note had directed all affiliated schools to  full waiver of fees including tuition fee and all other fees under any head except meals and transportation fee The schools were to implement this latest by April 

Carmel Convent argued that the girls school stands to lose around Rs  lakh a year because of the scheme The fee waiver the school underscored doesn make any differentiation based on the girls economic criteria 

The CBSE then backtracked and issued the second circular that gave some relief to private schools The Delhi High Court later dismissed the case

 incidence of health risks is very unequally distributed by educational level among employees showing an accumulation of health risks for those with the lowest educational attainments conclude the authors of a survey commissioned by the Upper Austrian Chamber of Labour  employees in a range of sectors were quizzed about their health between  and  for an investigation into work health problems

Unsurprisingly the handling of heavy loads at the workplace is most common among workers with the bare minimum of compulsory education  years schooling concerning one third of them against  of those with a secondary school diploma and  of university graduates Similar variations are observed for  work strain and  postures at work

A more unexpected finding is that blue suffer more from psychosocial stress than white workers   versus  respectively The idea that work stress is mainly a  phenomenon is disproved by the authors of the report Building workers suffer most from high or very high mental stress levels  followed by factory workers  and checkout staff  Only one manager out of three acknowledged being confronted with stress at their workplace

It is interesting to note that  of early school respondents expressed a lower need for personal development at work compared with just  of those with university degrees

 Constitution  Amendment Act  inserted Article  in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right in such a manner as the State may by law determine The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education  Act  which represents the consequential legislation envisaged under Article  means that every child has a right to full time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school which satisfies certain essential norms and standards

  and the RTE Act came into effect on  April  The title of the RTE Act incorporates the words free and compulsory Free education means that no child other than a child who has been admitted by his or her parents to a school which is not supported by the appropriate Government shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education Compulsory education casts an obligation on the appropriate Government and local authorities to provide and ensure admission attendance and completion of elementary education by all children in the  age group With this India has moved forward to a rights based framework that casts a legal obligation on the Central and State Governments to implement this fundamental child right as enshrined in the Article  of the Constitution in accordance with the provisions of the RTE Act

 incidence of health risks is very unequally distributed by educational level among employees showing an accumulation of health risks for those with the lowest educational attainments conclude the authors of a survey commissioned by the Upper Austrian Chamber of Labour  employees in a range of sectors were quizzed about their health between  and  for an investigation into work health problems

Unsurprisingly the handling of heavy loads at the workplace is most common among workers with the bare minimum of compulsory education  years schooling concerning one third of them against  of those with a secondary school diploma and  of university graduates Similar variations are observed for  work strain and  postures at work

A more unexpected finding is that blue suffer more from psychosocial stress than white workers   versus  respectively The idea that work stress is mainly a  phenomenon is disproved by the authors of the report Building workers suffer most from high or very high mental stress levels  followed by factory workers  and checkout staff  Only one manager out of three acknowledged being confronted with stress at their workplace

It is interesting to note that  of early school respondents expressed a lower need for personal development at work compared with just  of those with university degrees

 stakes testing of pupils has led to a system  on literacy and numeracy at the expense of the broader curriculum it suggests

The Cambridge Primary Review report claims this has contributed to  a  theory of learning

The government has defended its policies and denies that children are over at school

 Teachers representatives say the government must address these issues and the way it evaluates schools

The findings from four primary review research reports form part of an in assessment of the current state of primary school education in England 

One compiled by Dominic Wyse from the University of Cambridge and Elaine McCreery and Harry Torrance at Manchester Metropolitan University looks at the effects of an increasing government control of  the curriculum  between  and 

It said  evidence on the impact of the various initiatives on standards of pupil attainment is at best equivocal and at worst negative

 test scores have risen since the mid  this has been achieved at the expense of children entitlement to a broad and balanced curriculum and by the diversion of considerable teaching time to test preparation

Their report found  improvements in standards achieved by many pupils in primary schools

However it found  decrease in the overall quality of primary education experienced by pupils because of the narrowing of the curriculum and the intensity of test preparation

This amounted to a curriculum dominated by literacy and numeracy 

It also suggests the range of teaching methods employed is  even narrower now than hitherto

Another report by Maria Balarin and Hugh Lauder from the University of Bath identifies the existence of a  theory of learning where government control has been strengthened by  stakes testing of pupils a national curriculum and in primary schools mandated pedagogy in numeracy and literacy

On the issue of testing and the quality of primary education a Department for Children Schools and Families spokeswoman said  again we see a collection of recycled partial or out of date research 

 do not accept these claims We are currently engaged in a review of the primary curriculum as set out in the Children Plan which will build on a decade of success in raising standards  success which has been validated on numerous occasions by independent experts 

 government does not accept that our children are over

Disparities in funding  that see secondary schools attracting more money than primaries  also feature in the reports 

The National Union of Teachers  takes issue with the government interference in the education system and its  accountability systems of pupil testing and school inspections

NUT general secretary Steve Sinnott said  latest primary review reports demonstrate the damaging effects of high stakes testing inspection and historic underfunding on primary schools

 urge the government now to review its whole method of evaluating schools  

 government has a chance to tackle historic underfunding of primary schools Falling rolls should be seen as an opportunity not a threat  The funding gains created by smaller pupil numbers should be fed back into primary schools and not be seen as an opportunity to cut school budgets

A spokeswoman said  government has hugely increased funding for pupils of all ages  from early years into sixth form  and expanded the school workforce at all levels This means that primary standards are now at their highest ever levels 

 don specify centrally a ratio of primary to secondary pupil funding in each local area This is decided locally by local authorities in consultation with local schools and heads Seeing that all children leave primary school able to read write and calculate confidently is our highest priority 

The Liberal Democrats have accused the government of too  much interference

Education spokesman David Laws said  government attempts to micromanage schools are clearly deeply damaging 

 must stop their constant meddling in the curriculum and cease dictating to schools how they should educate our children

 children should follow a broad and balanced curriculum Too much time in primary schools is now spent on test preparation Creativity is at risk of being squeezed out of our classrooms

Ministers should review the current imbalance of funding between primary and secondary schools We need a transparent funding system which ensures that the most disadvantaged pupils come with extra funding so that they get the additional support they need

The Primary Review is an independent inquiry which is looking at  major themes before publishing final recommendations in October

 Paton Education Editor BST  May  Head teachers must pay the best teachers more money and resist pressure to set salaries based on the length of service in the classroom the Education Secretary warned  The comments came after it emerged that Britains two main teaching unions were attempting to scupper plans for performance pay by distributing their own advice to heads  Mr Gove has written to state schools across England warning them to shun the unlawful instructions  It was claimed that the guidance  from the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT  represented a substantial and serious attack on the Governments reforms and would prevent schools rewarding the top performing staff  The move represents a bitter escalation in the war of words between the Coalition and classroom unions over the introduction of a new system of teachers pay in England and Wales

But the government is setting up a review of how best to achieve this saying there are  issues

Schools Minister Jim Knight said this would factor in the ethos of schools pupils needs and parents values

A BBC poll of more than  people found two thirds would support sex lessons from the age of 

Reviews of education about sex and relationships and about drugs and alcohol were ordered after ministers said teaching was 

What they have not yet given is the detail of what compulsory personal social and health education  will involve to allow local flexibility

The Department for Children Schools and Families said the review of sex lessons had identified  need to challenge the perception that sex and relationships education happened in a  vacuum in schools and says that parents and schools can and should work together to decide how best topics should be taught

It said updated guidance would also be produced covering the content of the PSHE curriculum based on the existing non programme

Lessons should be  appropriate In primary schools Sir Jim Rose would look at how PSHE should best be delivered as part of his ongoing review of the curriculum

Please turn on JavaScript Media requires JavaScript to play Schools Minister Jim Knight explains the sex education changesThe new review of how to make PSHE compulsory will be led by a London head teacher Sir Alasdair MacDonald

Mr Knight told BBC News  are not suggesting that five and six should be taught sex

 we are saying is we need to improve in particular the relationship education improve the moral framework and moral understanding around which we then talk about sex later on in a child education

He said what schools would have to follow would be a high  of study But it would still be up to schools to decide what to teach

 groups for example will want to produce supplementary guidance on top of our guidance in order to say to their own schools  how they should then deliver that programme of study in a way that sympathetic to their moral beliefs their faith beliefs in those schools

The Catholic Education Service for England and Wales said it supported the priority given to establishing a  context for all sex and relationships teaching the recognition of the importance of the role of parents and the clear expectation that lessons would be shaped by Catholic teaching

The chief executive of the sexual health charity Brook Simon Blake said the news that PSHE was to be a statutory part of the national curriculum was  brilliant

He added  at last we can put the systems in place to give teachers and others the training and support they need to work effectively in partnership with children young people and their parents

The head of the Association of School and College Leaders  John Dunford has written to the government complaining that secondary schools have only just begun implementing major changes to the curriculum including highly regarded but non material on PSHE

 ASCL view it would be extremely detrimental to make PSHE compulsory or to change the revised secondary curriculum orders in any way at this point he wrote

It was not just a subject on the timetable

 is part of the ethos of the school helping to develop the young person in ways that schools deem most appropriate to their circumstances

 should not be the subject to further central prescription and certainly not compulsion

The sex education teaching requirements placed on schools at present are limited

In primary schools sex education is covered as part of the science curriculum

This tells children about the main body parts and explains that reproduction is one of the life processes common to all animals including humans

In secondary school again mainly through science lessons children cover the human reproductive cycle including adolescence fertilisation and foetal development

They may also learn  though there is no statutory requirement that they should  about relationship skills rights and responsibilities and different types of relationships contraception pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections and risky behaviours

In Wales sex and relationship education is already part of the curriculum and it is a legal requirement in Northern Ireland

The UK Youth Parliament says four out of  young people say they received no relationship education at school

Earlier this year figures were released showing that the number of abortions performed in the UK on girls under  had risen by  in 

A UK poll commissioned by the BBC from NOP found that the majority of those questioned believed sex and relationship lessons should be compulsory in schools

Of those  believed lessons should not start until children are at least  years old

Just over a third  said they did not think children should learn about contraception until they were at least

of the nation education initiative In order for Vocational

Education to play its part effectively in the changing national

context and for India to enjoy the fruits of the demographic

dividend there is an urgent need to redefine the critical elements

of imparting vocational education and training to make them

Government is well aware of the important role of Vocational

education and has already taken a number of important initiatives

in this area School vocational education in India is

currently covered by a centrally sponsored scheme which was mooted

in  and was aimed at providing an alternative to the pursuit of

higher academic education One of the objectives of the Vocational

Education Programme of NIOS is to meet the need for skilled and

middle manpower for the growing sectors of economy both

courses has been expanding over the years depending upon needs of

courses of NIOS are meant for both urban and rural sectors

 settle down Now has everyone got their poems out

Nothing unusual there you may think but this apparently normal English lesson is in fact taking place in a virtual classroom in a virtual school

Back in January Shan Jayran and her husband John Davies opened First College an online high school

Among its  students is  Zack from Grimsby

He was home from the age of seven after suffering panic attacks and bullying at school

Now he logs on to his computer at  BST Monday to Thursday chats in the  hall with classmates before entering his virtual classroom protected by a password half an hour later for his first lesson

 different from normal school I quite enjoying it he said

 any other kid I don like the homework But the teachers are nice and I just make sure I have a good internet connection

Classmate Natalie  was taught at a private school in London until last year

She loves her new school  the teachers new friends and using her computer

 my previous school teachers were bullies and kids were bullies in the playground she says

 didn learn much I used to be afraid of maths because my teacher was really horrible 

 you feel more confident because it is texting instead of speaking out loud and standing up

 old friends thought it was really cool but their parents thought  school  I don know about that

 don think I would ever go back to real school again

There are other obvious appeals  no uniform no school journey shorter days Fridays off no rushing no heavy bags and not being bustled about by large intimidating crowds

 puts them in control said Ms Jayran who sees the focus of the  school as being as much about creating a courteous community and building confidence as about teaching subjects

But it is neither a school for problem children nor a tutoring service she says

 a substitute I not saying that ordinary schools are going away but there are certainly going to be a lot more of these schools

On the curriculum is English maths history geography combined sciences and French with the option of taking International GCSEs 

In addition they study philosophy and society art and web design and Spanish is about to be introduced

There are four teachers who teach up to eight hours a week and can work from home or anywhere with access to a computer

It may sound straightforward but Ms Jayran admits she has already had to sack two teachers for being  boring

 were just copying stuff off the internet We demand a great deal If people wanted standard school teaching they would not be coming to us

Methods for rewarding disciplining and resolving conflict are among the peculiarities that come with teaching online

For good work teachers might ping across a picture of a cute kitten or a robot 

They have the option of reprimanding a student privately  by clicking on their username only  or in public in a shared access window where everyone can read his or her excuses

Resolving conflict takes on a whole new dimension as every interaction between students and teachers is on record 

But while students seem happy at virtual school and parents say they are pleased with their progress sitting at a computer for five hours a day does have some side

There is no physical exercise or eye contact little verbal and physical communication and no chance to learn how to handle the bustle and bullying in the playground

Ms Jayran said there were plans to encourage more use of microphones in English and French even to introduce webcams 

So far though these have been met with some resistance by students happier quietly texting and retreating from the pressures of speaking up in class

 There were plans too for a summer camp but poor take meant it was cancelled

Ms Jayran said a lot of the issues to do with socialising and physical exercise fell to the parents

Natalie mother Hilary who also has a son at the school said it had not proved difficult for them

 have got a lot of friends who live locally and they get exercise at weekends

 can really think of any problems with it To be honest I just surprised it taken so long to catch on

 city Education Departments test kitchen  where new recipes are invented prepared and tasted for the citys  million students each day  is a bastion of creative concoctions that a team of experienced chefs is constantly revising and improving

 its a new concept it might take three or four times before we get it right said Jorge Collazo the test kitchens executive chef who has  years on the job and oversees a staff of  chefs in Long Island City Queens Were doing more made cooking than ever

 of double convection ovens electric steamers and the stand of refrigerators come fresh lunches like savory roasted barbecue chicken and Cuban pulled turkey sandwiches

 dish is approved unless it inspires a desire to go back for seconds Once a dish makes the menu the culinary staff at the citys more than  school kitchens can place orders and make it for students

 have a tough job because when you have a bunch of people sitting around the table you try to make everybody happy said Eric Goldstein chief executive of the Office of School Support Services Were constantly thinking How do we make school food better 

 city schools once cafeteria eats like plain pizza burgers and processed chicken have evolved into baked falafel on a toasted whole wheat pita curried chickpeas with roasted zucchini and honey mustard chicken filet sandwiches with veggies

 none of it the chefs report proudly is cooked with butter or high corn syrup The low nondeep meals are instead cooked with herbs soy and curry sauces to add flavor

 years ago this department didnt exist said Goldstein We didnt have people with culinary backgrounds making menus 

 culinary creations are tested with focus groups of about  students a few times every year If something doesnt meet with the approval of  of the young gourmets its back to Collazos cutting board

 Paton Education Editor BST  Sep  A study found that teachers were significantly more likely to believe that pay should be linked to teaching quality than the amount of time spent in the classroom  Around a fifth of teachers believed that experience should not be a driver when it comes to setting staff salary levels  The conclusions come despite widespread opposition from classroom unions to the creation of a new pay structure for teachers that will link future wage rises to performance  On Tuesday members the National Union of Teachers and NASUWT will take part in a strike across the Midlands Yorkshire and east of England in an attempt to block the proposals  It comes before a major national walk out across England and Wales later in the autumn tem

 Paton Education Editor BST  May  More than three of school staff are in favour of linking salaries to performance in the classroom figures show despite widespread opposition to the move from unions  Almost half of teachers questioned said pay rises should be determined by pupils results it was revealed  The disclosure  in a survey from the Sutton Trust charity  comes just days after it emerged that the Department for Education has written to the body charged with reviewing teachers salaries in England asking it to strengthen the link between performance and pay  MPs on the Commons Education Select Committee have also supported the move saying that changes are needed to stop the worst teachers hiding behind a rigid national salary structure  

 It comes after an official report from Ofsted the education watchdog found that teaching standards were not good enough in four schools  often leading to poor pupil behaviour  Sir Peter Lampl chairman of the Sutton Trust which campaigns to improve social mobility said the worst teachers should be required to take on training to bring them up to standard   is right that teachers pay should be related to their performance and they should also be required to undertake professional development if they are not performing at an effective level he said  We need to strike the right balance between attempting to improve the performance of poorly performing teachers through professional development and our responsibility to safeguard children right to being taught effectively  The Trust surveyed  primary and secondary teachers in England as part of the study  It found that  per cent of teachers were in favour of some form of performance pay  Some  per cent said increases should be awarded to all teachers other than those judged to be performing badly Another  per cent thought that rises should be reserved for the very best performers  Only a quarter of teachers backed pay rises for all staff although this plummeted to just one among heads and deputy heads  When asked how best to judge teachers performance almost half of those surveyed said it should be linked to the progress and results of pupils they currently teach Two backed a system of internal school assessment by more senior colleagues  The results come despite claims from major classroom unions that performance pay rises would cause chaos in schools  Earlier this week the National Union of Teachers said it would result in staff attempting to exaggerate pupils progress to secure lucrative bonuses  causing mutual distrust in staffrooms  It was also claimed that teachers would be required to teach to the test to boost results  leading to a reduction in productive lesson time In Education News
