policy northern ireland probably caused many idealistic misguided young catholics join ira administrative detention muslims similar effect now surely public better protected security services rather alerting suspect terrorist placing house arrest longthey place suspect terrorist surveillance maybe acquire sufficient evidence prosecute even better prevent terrorist attack don't usually much time mr forsyth largely right wing views time got spot doubt terrorist organisations like harm u k doubtful whether al qaeda global organisation co ordinating rise surveillance cameras cards plan charge

personal freedom usually agree mr forsyth spot single biggest threat face government dedicated acting illegally manipulating international national law suit purpose totalitarianism always requires outside threat justifying range extraordinary powers leaders want british government far greater threat terrorist organisation although principle agree frederick forsyth fails address one key point al

agree many sentiments can moral justification imposing system government anyone systematically depriving citizens basic individual collective freedoms whilst principle keeping potential terrorists house arrest might seem superficially attractive unfortunately also first step towards totalitarianism decide suspect believe can faith honesty integrity competence intelligence services politicians light events recent years stop false denunciations falsely accused will lose careers will support families will children still go school smacks methods nazi germany stalin russia ceausescu romania
