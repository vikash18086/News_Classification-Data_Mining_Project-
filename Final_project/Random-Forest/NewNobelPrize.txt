Some Animals Are More Equal than OthersSummaryHHMI Paul Modrich shares  Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Tomas Lindahl and Aziz Sancar for studies of DNA repair Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced today that Paul Modrich a Howard Hughes Medical Institute  investigator at Duke University Tomas Lindahl of the Francis Crick Institute and Clare Hall Laboratory in the UK and Aziz Sancar of University of North Carolina Chapel Hill are the recipients of the  Nobel Prize in Chemistry for mechanistic studies of DNA repair trio is being honored for having mapped at a molecular level how cells repair damaged DNA and safeguard the genetic information According to the Nobel Foundation their work has provided fundamental knowledge of how a living cell functions and is for instance used for the development of new cancer treatments  to Modrich interview with the Nobel Foundation day our DNA is damaged by UV radiation free radicals and other carcinogenic substances but even without such external attacks a DNA molecule is inherently unstable Thousands of spontaneous changes to a cell genome occur on a daily basis Furthermore defects can also arise when DNA is copied during cell division a process that occurs several million times every day in the human body  who has been an HHMI investigator at Duke since   studies pathways that control mutation production Much of his work has addressed strand mismatch repair Inactivation of mismatch repair is the cause of the most common form of hereditary colon cancer and aberrant action of the pathway plays an important role in the development of a number of neurodegenerative diseases repair rectifies base errors within the DNA helix Although a mismatched base pair is a rare occurrence in DNA inactivation of this repair system has profound consequences for a living cell a  to  increase in mutation production In humans mismatch repair defects are the cause of the most common form of hereditary colon cancer  and are believed to contribute to the development of a subset of sporadic tumors that occur in a variety of tissues of DNA Repair  created by Graham Johnson of up in a small town in northern New Mexico instilled Modrich with a love of the natural world  was huge biological diversity around me he says  five miles the ecology can change dramatically was very thought provoking His father the local high school biology teacher encouraged his curiosity In  when he was a junior in high school Modrich remembers his dad giving him very important advice  should learn about this DNA stuff heeded this counsel For most of his career he has studied how organisms prevent the occurrence of mutations in their genetic material Particularly he has identified and characterized the proteins in what is called the mismatch repair  system a key proofreading mechanism that cells use to eliminate rare errors from DNA that occur during chromosome replication mistakes creep into DNA code during the formation of sperm and egg cells they can cause mutations that are passed down through generations If damaging genetic alterations occur inside cells of the adult body cancers may arise Before Modrich findings about MMR scientists had studied the enzyme DNA polymerase which is responsible for copying the A T G C letters that compose the genetic language that resides within the DNA of chromosomes They had established how the enzyme does so with high accuracy one mistake for every  million DNA  copied Normally A in DNA pairs with T and C pairs with G DNA polymerase errors take the form of a mismatch such as A pairing with C G with T G with G and so on showed how the MMR system functions as a copyeditor to correct the rare errors left by DNA polymerase  human cells MMR reduces the error rate by a factor of a thousand Modrich explains In healthy cells approximately one mutation occurs per cell division Without MMR this number increases to about  first became interested in molecular genetics as an undergraduate when he helped out in a lab that studied the genetics of viruses that infect bacteria For his Ph thesis at Stanford Modrich studied how the enzyme ligase works and showed that it is essential for the microbe Escherichia coli viability Ligase is a protein that glues together two ends in double DNA It functions in many essential DNA actions such as DNA replication repair of DNA lesions and recombination when chromosomes exchange genetic material experience with DNA and the proteins and enzymes that interact with the molecule allowed him in the late  to start tackling a system that finds and fixes the very rare mismatched base pairs that result from DNA polymerase errors At the time molecular biologist Matthew Meselson posited that the process required two sites on DNA the mismatch and a second DNA site that is used to distinguish the newly synthesized error strand from the parental template strand that is being copied Eventually Modrich developed biochemical assays that allowed detection of mismatch repair in extracts of E coli which permitted his lab to identify the nature and functions of  proteins responsible for mismatch repair in this microbe of the things I like about research is the problem aspect of it says Modrich reflecting on the time it took to characterize MMR  don really feel a sense of urgency I get a lot of satisfaction from the small steps that humans also have an MMR system Modrich and his colleagues demonstrated that was the case in  They showed that this reaction is defective in a common form of colon cancer that runs in families and identified a number of proteins that participate in human MMR Since then he and other researchers have found that genetic inactivation of any of four human MMR genes can lead to cancer Physicians now use these findings in cancer diagnosis Modrich is further dissecting the molecular mechanisms of MMR in humans He also is investigating MMR role in how certain cancers become resistant to chemotherapy and the involvement of the MMR system in causing diseases such as Huntington his career Modrich has subscribed to the idea that basic research often leads to unanticipated results that ultimately have value for human health and disease  we not had a basic knowledge of MMR in bacteria we wouldn have guessed that defects in the human pathway were the cause of hereditary colon cancer Modrich says  is why curiosity research is so important You never know where it is going to lead A little luck helps too resources for science teachers and students including animations short films

Related Nobel peace prize  goes to Tunisian civil society groups  live updates The quartet was set up in the summer of  at a time when the country Jasmine revolution which had first sparked the Arab spring looked like it would go the same way as Egypt brief democratic awakening which had succumbed to a military coup in July of that year Tunisia was suffering some of the same symptoms as Egypt a high Islamist government that was ignoring the views of the secular opposition in writing up a new constitution street clashes high assassinations and the appearance of Salafist extremists on the fringes quartet  made up of the union federation UGTT the employers institute the Tunisian human rights league and the order of lawyers  brokered talks between the different forces and got them to agree a roadmap that included compromises on the constitution a technocratic caretaker government and an independent election commission Abassi the secretary general of one of the member organisations the Tunisian General Labour Union said he was overwhelmed by the prize  a message that dialogue can lead us on the right path This prize is a message for our region to put down arms and sit and talk at the negotiation table he told Reuters members of the quartet have gone their own way since its peak in  and Tunisia still faces severe problems including public disillusion with the government  which has been largely recaptured by pre elites  and terrorist attacks culminating in the massacre of  tourists in Sousse in June alone among Arab spring states Tunisia has kept its democratic aspirations alive in the wake of the Egyptian coup and the conflicts that have consumed Libya Syria and Yemen Related Attacks by  state leave Tunisia truth commission in crisis  faces significant

is recognised for its revolution and for the consensual path it has chosen for its democratic transition Her commission praised by human rights groups has been struggling against opposition from some quarters as it sifts through  allegations of abuse stretching back through  years of dictatorship Tunisia director of Human Rights Watch Amna Guellali said the prize was seen in the country as a reward for sticking with democratic principles  quartet enabled the democratic process to go ahead it was a political crisis that could have led to civil war she said  here will hope the award is not just a token celebration but will bring Tunisia real help Related Nobel peace prize national dialogue brought Tunisia back from the brink Sarah Chayes a Tunisia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said  quartet was a disparate entity made up of groups that did not necessarily see eye to eye historically So there had to be a kind of peacemaking within the quartet before it could perform its function That is a first so far as I know in Nobel history quartet worked very hard to achieve the result it did Chayes added  was not a matter of elegant words or a certain stance The quartet leadership spent all end to end cajoled taught helped and threatened political actors to produce a solution to the situation of political crisis in which they were mired Nobel committee said the quartet had secured the approval of the Tunisian population at large for the constitutional process that led to democratic elections quartet paved the way for a peaceful dialogue between the citizens the political parties and the authorities and helped to find consensus solutions to a wide range of challenges across political and religious divides it said broad national dialogue that the quartet succeeded in establishing countered the spread of violence in Tunisia and its function is therefore comparable to that of the peace congresses to which Alfred Nobel refers in his will Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallstr said the award to the Tunisian quartet was well deserved  is a long and difficult process to achieve democratic reforms in a country that has been subjected to such a difficult situation but it has done everything right and it has been done with active support from civil society she told the broadcaster STV who has advocated a feminist foreign policy for Sweden particularly praised Tunisia establishment of a new constitution anchored among women and young people and its attempts to establish consensus between different parties Sign in

 CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links his will the wealthy Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel money to fund what would become among the most famous prizes in the world the Nobel Peace Prize was unmarried and had no descendants when he died on Dec   Given the huge sums of money involved will was controversial unlike most such wills controversy  and action still surrounds Nobel because of prize Nobel wanted to be presented each to the  worthy of the  of peace Nobel wrote in his that his peace should go to  person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses Dec  the  Nobel Peace Prize will be presented to Tunisia Dialogue Quartet  its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution of  Bouchamaoui is a member of the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet which was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize for  its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia  Messara committee choice announced on Friday was greeted with both praise and criticism International Peace Bureau which won the prize in  says the choice makes a vital contribution  the building of fair and peaceful societies everywhere by pushing an alternative  military intervention and to terrorist violence IPB likes that this year award goes to a grassroots civil society organization  is a bottom prize rather than another top one unlike many previous awards the IPB said Peace Prize Watch  says the Quartet  clearly outside the circle of recipients Nobel had in mind Heffermehl who served as vice of the IPB and also is a of the NPPW shares in latter assessment years ago the peace activist and Norwegian lawyer authored Nobel Peace Prize What Nobel Really Wanted Nobel Peace Prize should go to the most worthy champions of peace Alfred Nobel wrote in his will  Roald Norway an interview with CBC News Heffermehl his book first evaluation from a legal standpoint of what Nobel achieve with his will After going through Nobel correspondence he it clear Nobel wanted the prize to go to people working for disarmament and to abolish militarism and who were building a peace movement described as a peace activist during his later years original intent expressed a  visionary idea of peace and his vision remains a great idea for a prize today perhaps more urgently in the era of nuclear weapons the prize was first awarded in  only six times  the speech for the laureate given express reference to Nobel intention with the peace prize according to Heffermehl last time was in  when former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev won includes a report card on the first  peace prizes He grades  awards as  justified Since  when the Red Cross won  to  he rates  of the winners not meeting Nobel criteria is quite critical of the Norwegian Nobel committee the body that chooses the Peace Prize winners President Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in   months into his presidency He accepted the prize uncomfortably acknowledging his role as a leader at war while insisting that conflict could be morally justified  Samad Images said in his will that a five committee elected by the Norwegian parliament should select the  of peace Heffermehl said the five members oppose the idea of the will of people dedicated to disarmament the idea of Nobel parliamentarians are taking the seats for themselves he said adding rather corrupt the Norwegian committee decides on the winner it the Nobel Foundation in Sweden that sends the winner a cheque early  at Heffermehl request the Sweden that oversees foundations an investigation which he said led to the Nobel Foundation recognizing that they are the ones who  the final and ultimate responsibility for all funds being used in conformity with the purpose that year the committee across the border in Norway awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union infuriating Heffermehl who sees the EU as supporting the use of military means as the road to peace past laureates  Africa Desmond Tutu Northern Ireland Mairead Maguire Argentina Adolfo P Esquivel and the IPB  joined Heffermehl and others in protesting the choice They wrote that the  is clearly not  champion of peace that Alfred Nobel had in mind when he wrote his will Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Fran Hollande and other EU leaders at the  ceremony to present the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union a choice that has led to legal action against the Nobel Foundation  on their website The Nobel Foundation says it  not have the right or mandate to influence the nomination and selection procedures of the Nobel laureates disagrees if the foundation doles out the money to someone outside the scope or purpose Nobel stated that would constitute misappropriation of funds an illegal payment for which the board members become personally liable has been pursuing several legal angles and on Sept  in Stockholm he and his colleagues initiated court proceedings against the foundation board members over the  prize In that case they are asking the Stockholm city court to declare the  payment to the EU an illegal use of the foundation funds said are still awaiting a response from board members Friday CBC News

Article Details MaranzaniHistory Things You May Not Know About the Nobel Prizeshttp   NetworksWhen Swedish chemist and philanthropist Alfred Nobel  made much of his money from his invention of dynamite died on December   his will stipulated that his fortune be used to fund individuals or organizations that provide the  benefit on mankind The Nobel Prizes awarded annually on the anniversary of Nobel death remain some of the most prestigious awards in the world Check out seven things you may not know about the Nobel Prizes So you want to win a Nobel Prize Here are the rules


As much as you might like to you can nominate yourself for a Nobel Prize else has to do it for you You must be alive at the time of your nomination  on that later If you are nominated you likely never know unless you win There are more than  initial nominees for the various awards each year a number that is narrowed down by a selection committee to a shortlist  three to five people or organizations The names of the initial nominees as well as those shortlisted are kept secret for  years in part to prevent lobbying on the behalf of nominees Technically the Economics award is not really a Nobel Prize


Alfred Nobel will stipulated the creation of just five awards physics chemistry physiology or medicine literature and peace However since  a sixth award has been handed out In  to honor its  anniversary Sweden central bank created an endowment to fund a new prize honoring achievements in economic studies Properly known as the  of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel the award recipients are chosen by the Swedish Academy of Sciences  also select the prizes in chemistry and physics in conjunction with a prize committee  from the one that issues the awards in other categories and recipients receive their awards at the same December ceremony Mahatma Gandhi never won the Nobel Peace Prize


Beginning in  Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi was nominated for the award five times His final nomination came just weeks after his assassination in January  At that point in its history the Nobel Committee had never awarded a prize posthumously though its original governing charter did allow for this in extenuating circumstances However the committee determined that Gandhi had left behind no suitable heirs or organizations able to accept the award or its prize money Unwilling to bestow the award posthumously yet recognizing Gandhi lifelong commitment to non they instead decided not to award that year peace prize to anyone stating that there were no  living candidates worthy of the award The Gandhi controversy endures In  Dag Hammarskj Secretary of the United Nations was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize even though he had died in a plane crash earlier that year When the Dalai Lama was awarded the peace prize in  he announced that he was accepting the award in part as a tribute to Gandhi And in  more than  years after Gandhi death the Nobel Committee itself publicly acknowledged the omission expressing regret that Gandhi had never been awarded the prize For the Curies the Nobel Prizes were a family affair


In  Marie Curie became the first female Nobel laureate when she and her husband Pierre were awarded the physics prize  were also the first husband and wife team to win Eight years later Marie won a second Nobel this time on her own and in the chemistry field In  Marie and Pierre daughter Irene was awarded a prize in chemistry which she shared with her husband Frederic Joliot That five awards in just two generations The Curie curious connection to the Nobel doesn end there though In  Marie and Pierre son Henry Labouisse was serving as Executive Director of UNICEF when that organization was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize Albert Einstein ex got his Nobel Prize money


The marriage of physicist Albert Einstein and his first wife Mileva Maric was rocky from the start A promising scientist herself Mileva abandoned her studies after they wed in  and soon devoted herself to raising their two sons In  Einstein left his family moving to Berlin while Mileva and the boys remained in Switzerland Two years earlier Einstein had begun a relationship with his cousin Elsa and he was soon pressuring Mileva for a divorce After five years of negotiations they finally agreed on a settlement Einstein never in doubt of his own talents promised that the monetary award from any future Nobel Prize he received would be put in trust for his sons with Mileva allowed to draw from the interest Mileva accepted and when Einstein was awarded the Nobel in physics in  the prize money was duly transferred over to his former wife Several people have turned down the Nobel


It rare but it has happened French philosopher and writer Jean Satre was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in  but declined that  any other official honors In  Communist Vietnamese leader Le Duc Tho was jointly awarded the peace prize with U Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for their work negotiating the Paris Peace Accords during the Vietnam War Kissinger accepted his award but Tho refused stating that a true peace had not actually been achieved When Russian poet and novelist Boris Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in  he quickly accepted telegraphing the Nobel Committee that he was  thankful and  however officials of the Soviet Union who had successfully prevented publication of Pasternak work  Doctor Zhivago almost immediately pressured him into rejecting the prize The Nobel Foundation would not select another winner nor would it remove Pasternak name from the record books Finally near the end of the Cold War in  Pasternak son Yevgeny accepted the award on his father behalf As of  only  different women have won Nobel Prizes


Between  and   people  organizations have been awarded either a Nobel Prize or Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and fewer than  of those awards have gone to women Women have had the most success with the peace prize receiving the award  times followed by  awards in literature  American authors Pearl Buck and Toni Morrison and  in physiology or medicine However they have not fared nearly as well in economics physics or chemistry winning just seven awards in those three categories combined two of those were won by Marie Curie in the early  century were the first women to win Nobel Prizes Albert Szent Steinbeck Wins Nobel PrizeEinstein Einstein Nobel PrizeAlone in the wilderness Get your survival kit at the History Store  A Television Networks LLC All Rights Reserved

The Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology has been awarded to three scientists at American universities who are unraveling how the body protects chromosomes carrier of the genetic code for life the Nobel Prize assembly announced today in Stockholm 


The Nobel Prize of  million U dollars  million Swedish kronor will be split equally between Australian Elizabeth Blackburn at the University of California San Francisco American Carole Greider at Johns Hopkins University and British Jack Szostak at Harvard University

It the first time that the Nobel Prize in medicine has been awarded to two women at the same time


  Prize for Medicine Goes to HIV HPV Discoverers 


 spoke to them all this morning and they were a bit sleepy when they got the call but they were all very happy and are looking forward to coming to Stockholm to receive their prize said G Hansson Nobel Prize committee secretary


The winning scientists work has revealed how the ends of chromosomes can be copied which has implications for understanding human aging cancer and several inherited diseases 


 have solved a fundamental mystery and opened up a whole new field of research said Shankar Balasubramanian a telomere expert at the University of Cambridge in the U 


Telomeres are the caps on the end of chromosomes which carry the genetic code that written in our DNA 


 the Nobel Prize science quick guide to chromosomes and human genetics


When cells divide and replicate the DNA molecules must be copied However during division the ends of the strands of DNA can degrade 


In theory telomeres therefore the chromosome as a whole become significantly shorter every time a cell divides but in some cases they don enigma that had perplexed scientists for decades 


But in  Blackburn and Szostak discovered that a unique DNA sequence in the telomeres protects the chromosomes from degrading


Later in  Greider and Blackburn identified telomerase the enzyme that makes telomere DNA and prevents chromosomes from shortening and becoming unstable 


As telomeres shorten each time a cell divides the process contributes to cell aging


But when the telomerase enzyme is very active the telomere length is maintained the cell eternal youth This process allows cancer cells to grow and divide without aging


Inhibiting or interfering with telomerase in cancer cells may kill the cell and someday cure cancer scientists say 


Several promising clinical trials are under way in this area making the unique enzyme discovery  scientific progress said Nobel Prize committee member Jan Andersson of the Karolinska Institute 


Likewise some age illnesses such as Alzheimer disease may be linked to a lack of telomerase activity causing the cell to degrade quicker 


Boosting telomerase activity could help to slow down aging and stabilize some of these illnesses scientists say


Furthermore a number of inherited diseases are caused by telomerase defects including congenital aplastic anemia which occurs when cells don divide sufficiently inside bone marrow


 was always clear that nature was doing something unusual to maintain telomeres but it took a lot of intuition to ask the right questions and understand what was going on Cambridge Balasubramanian said


 Greider and Szostak did that and by doing so opened up a very significant new area of biology linked to several important human conditions he added


The Nobel Prize has been awarded since  as directed in the will of chemist engineer and dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel 


This year prizes in physics chemistry literature peace and economics will be announced over the next two weeks 


The awards are officially handed out each year at a ceremony on December  the anniversary of Nobel death

Purdue President France A C at left talks Wednesday   with Purdue University professor Ei Negishi Nobel Laureate in chemistry at his home in West Lafayette Ind Negishi is the Herbert C Brown Distinguished Professor of Chemistry  University photo Hancock imageWEST LAFAYETTE Ind  A Purdue University chemist on Wednesday   was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for creating a method to build complex organic molecules necessary for numerous purposes from pharmaceutical manufacturing to electronics Negishi   Na the Herbert C Brown Distinguished Professor of Chemistry was a co of the prize with scientists Richard Heck of the University of Delaware in Newark and Akira Suzuki of Hokkaido University in Sapporo Japan They will share the  million award President France A C said the university was proud that Negishi and his work were recognized by the Nobel Prize committee Negishi work in organic molecules is groundbreaking and inspiring especially in its application for improving medicines and impacting lives C said  are very proud that he has been bestowed with this highest honor We congratulate professor Negishi and celebrate this great accomplishment developed metal reactions called palladium cross that allow for easy and efficient synthesis of complex organic compounds Examples of applications include drug manufacturing fluorescent marking that has been essential for DNA sequencing and creating materials for thin LED displays discovered catalytic reactions using a number of transition metals that allow various organic compounds to be synthesized widely efficiently and selectively for use in fields ranging from medicine to materials development His work has resulted in dramatically reducing the cost of using such metals like palladium in the synthesis are not lost as they spur a chemical reaction they are recycled and can be used over and over again he said  transition metals are very expensive but when they can be used millions to billions of times it dramatically reduces the cost and makes the mass manufacturing of special complex materials practical likened the innovation to playing with a LEGO game altering the building blocks of molecules and using transition metals as catalysts to promote the reactions needed for the synthesis found catalysts and created reactions that allow complex organic compounds to in effect snap together with other compounds to more economically and efficiently build desired materials he said  can be combined to make things of any shape size and color and our reactions make this a possibility for organic compounds The National Institute of General Medical Sciences  which is part of the National Institutes of Health has supported Negishi work since  methodology has vastly improved the possibilities to create sophisticated chemicals and has broad implications for the medical electronic and agricultural fields said NIH director Francis S Collins  has already allowed chemists to synthesize compounds to fight the herpes virus HIV and colon cancer director Jeremy M Berg said Negishi work focuses on the carbon bonds that form the backbones of organic molecules  bonds are like the frame of a house  you have to get them right for the structure to be functional and useful Berg said  developing a more precise and efficient method for making these bonds Dr Negishi created a remarkably powerful tool for synthesizing a wide range of useful chemicals Nobel Prize was bestowed primarily on the strength of  seminal papers published from  to  said Negishi who came to

I been reporting on the Nobel Peace Prize for three decades One of my first assignments as a journalist was to interview the late daughter of  Carl Von Ossietzky winner of the  award She lived in a suburb of Stockholm We liked each other and I ended up spending a whole day with her She let me hold her father Nobel medal and told me many fascinating and horrific stories of his persecution by the Nazis I continued to write and comment on the prize in the intervening years and I regularly attend the award ceremonies and other Nobel events in Oslo In  World Scientific published a volume I edited on the Nobel Peace Lectures Nobel Peace Prize for  Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is a worthy recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize one that follows a long tradition of awards to individuals and groups working for disarmament The work is as vital as ever and a crucial part of the international peace effort But for those of us gathered at the Nobel Institute in Oslo for the announcement the news didn seem surprising or even very exciting Many of us would have preferred that the award go to an individual rather than an organization like Malala Yusoufzai for example who has emerged as one of today most compelling symbols of freedom and courage Read more the Nobel Peace Prize Overtly Political winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are chosen by current and former politicians so it hardly a surprise that the award often carries political overtones But if your politics are motivated by a yearning for peace freedom democracy human rights and the empowerment of women is that a bad thing I discuss that question with Larisa Epatko of the PBS Newshour Read more Assange  A Likely Nominee an Unlikely LaureateIn late January a few days before the nomination deadline for the  Nobel Peace Prize I was contacted by an AFP reporter asking if I had any idea who might be nominated this year I told him I heard a few rumors and seen some buzz online about a few potential nominees But none of them seemed especially noteworthy I said By way of speculation I added that a nomination for Julian Assange founder of WikiLeaks seemed likely Read more Nobel Peace Prize for Liu Xiaobo winner of the  Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on October  and as always there is a lot of speculation about who will get it After the Norwegian Nobel Committee surprised everybody last year by giving the prize to President Obama many have suggested that the five board will choose a more traditional peace laureate this year  a champion of human rights perhaps or a statesman with a well record of international peacemaking A prize to the Chinese pro activist Liu Xiaobo would be well though perhaps less timely than it would have been last year Read more on President Obama Nobel Peace PrizeAwards given to statesmen always present certain challenges and the  Nobel Peace Prize to Barack Obama is no exception While it true that no one has done more in the preceding year  strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples as the Nobel citation put it and that thanks to President Obama the United States is now playing a more constructive role on a wide range of global fronts many are right to wonder whether the president less than a year into his first term really deserves the prize for that Read more on the  Nobel Peace PrizeLike most people I was stunned by the news that Barack Obama had won the  Nobel Peace Prize But I was perhaps equally stunned by the media whirlwind that surrounded the news after it broke As it happened I got swept up in it myself and was interviewed by many news organizations grappling with the implications of a prize not just to a sitting president but to one less than a year into his first term Here are some links to news reports and stories in which I quoted or for which I was interviewed Peace LecturesNobel Lectures Peace  is the latest in a series of volumes presenting the texts of the Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speeches In addition to the Nobel lectures for the years  the book offers a detailed introduction to each prize the official announcement of the award the presentations speeches by the Norwegian Nobel Committee chairman biographies of the laureates and extensive notes and bibliographies Edited with the distinguished historian Irwin Abrams the book was published by World Scientific in  under the auspices of the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm It includes a foreword by Geir Lundestad executive director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute More information  Nobel Peace Prize A Photo EssayThe  Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Al Gore

EVANSTON Ill  Dale T Mortensen the Ida C Cook Professor of Economics at Northwestern University Judd A and Marjorie Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences won the  Nobel Prize in Economics won the prize with Peter Diamond Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Christopher Pissarides London School of Economics and Political Science in the United Kingdom three economists will share a total prize of  million prize recognized  analysis of markets with search frictions the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said The three developed a framework that seeks to explain why there are so many people unemployed at the same time as there are a large number of job openings Their model helps explain the ways in which unemployment job vacancies and wages are affected by regulation and economic policy and can also be applied to other areas including the housing market is a great honor for Professor Mortensen and for Northwestern and a recognition of the important research that is being done at the University On behalf of the entire Northwestern community I extend my congratulations to Professor Mortensen said Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro found out about the prize today in Denmark during lunch with a colleague just prior to a seminar where a visitor from the U talked about data related to data Mortensen has been studying in Denmark He was caught off guard when he got the call indicating that even though he knows people who decide the prizes he hadn heard a word jokingly gave the simplest explanation of his complicated research when questioned during a conference call with the media today from Aarhus University in Denmark  takes time for workers to find jobs and for employers to find workers he said Nobel Prize is given for work done over a very long time stressed Mortensen who has been at Northwestern since  often tease him about his long tenure at Northwestern in relation to his work about matching employers and employees  entire career has been at Northwestern and one of the things I study is why people move They say I study it to see what other people do pioneered the theory of job search and search unemployment and extended it to study labor turnover research and development personal relationships and labor reallocation His insight that friction is equivalent to the random arrival of trading partners has become the leading technique for analysis of labor markets and the effects of labor market policy The development of equilibrium dynamic models designed to account for wage dispersion the time series behavior of job and worker flows and the role of reallocation in the determination of aggregate growth and productivity are the principal topics of his current research His publications include more than  scientific articles His book  Dispersion Why Are Similar Workers Paid Differently was published by MIT Press in  is the second current or former faculty member of Northwestern to recently receive a Nobel Prize in Economics Roger B Myerson who received a Nobel in economics in  while a professor at the University of Chicago was a member of the faculty in the Kellogg School of Management from  to  It was during that time that much of his Nobel research was conducted of Mortensen co Peter Diamond was the winner of the first Edwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics which is awarded every other year by Northwestern University to a leading figure in economics Diamond received the Nemmers Prize in  Diamond is the fourth recipient of the Nemmers Prize to subsequently be awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics Nobel Prize in Economics was established by Sweden Riksbank in  to mark the central bank  anniversary The prize is awarded annually for  of outstanding importance in the field of economic science and the winners are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences comments about Professor Dale Mortensen of us at Northwestern University are thrilled that Professor Dale Mortensen a member of our faculty in the Department of Economics since  has received this year Nobel Prize said Northwestern University Provost Daniel Linzer  many contributions in his scholarship are matched by his long record of excellence in teaching and service at Northwestern We extend our congratulations to Dale and to his colleagues and students an economist I always felt that Dale was the most intuitive and smartest guy in the department said Joel Mokyr Robert Strotz Professor of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern  is a wonderful colleague and a great human being and his work has been absolutely pathbreaking He explains a great deal about why at any given point in time there are a lot of people who are not working and he gives a very rich and extremely useful theory of unemployment that very different from our normal ideas of unemployment has certainly made fundamental contributions to help us understand how markets move toward equilibrium especially in labor markets said Ronald Brauetigam Harvey Kapnick Professor of Economics and associate provost for undergraduate education at Northwestern  basic problem is often described as the search process or the process of matching primarily between employers and employees What Dale did with his research starting four decades ago was to help us understand how this very complicated matching process works At the microeconomic level we understand a lot better how matches actually take place at the level of the individual worker and the individual firm And at the macro level his work has helped us understand how matching affects the aggregate level of employment in the economy So these are very important contributions Mortensen work puts flesh on the bones of the theory of markets said Robert Coen professor emeritus of economics at Northwestern  textbook description of a market is a place where buyers and sellers come together to exchange goods and services In practice buyers and sellers don just come together they have to find one another in what may be a lengthy and complicated search with each side having to decide at each point whether to stop searching and make a trade continue searching or drop out of the market By advancing models of how markets actually work he lays the groundwork for systematic assessments of the impacts of economic policies on market performance for example on how unemployment benefits or employment subsidies affect unemployment and the allocation of labor The significance and inspiring quality of Dale work is evident in the extraordinary number of graduate students he has mentored at Northwestern and elsewhere and the number of research collaborators he has found worldwide University  Clark Street Evanston IL   Evanston   Chicago   webmaster

Brain power equals chocolate squared according to a study that says countries with high chocolate consumption produce more Nobel Laureates notes published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Franz Messerli compared the number of Nobel Laureates in each country to per capita annual chocolate consumption correlation found a  powerful correlation that Messerli claims could mean that chocolate enhances cognitive functioning seems most likely that in a dose way chocolate intake provides the abundant fertile ground needed for the sprouting of Nobel laureates said Messerli pointed to previous studies which found that regular intake of flavanols present in cocoa could improve cognitive functioning in the elderly and in rats Swiss big chocolate reach his conclusions Messerli plotted countries annual chocolate consumption against the number of Nobel Laureates per  million in the population  chose the number of Nobel Laureates as a measure of the  of people in a given country that showed superior cognitive functioning


The study author chocolate consumption against Nobel Laureate winners graphThe Swiss consumed the most chocolate and produced the most Nobel Laureates Germans and British also regularly indulged in chocolate while churning out top prizes for academic excellence Swedish anomalyHowever Sweden presented Messerli with an anomaly Its chocolate consumption was relatively low but it was producing the second highest number of Nobel Laureates should have produced  Nobel Laureates yet we observe  said MesserliHe put this down to potential favoritism or Swedish sensitivity to chocolate cannot quite escape the notion that either the Nobel Committee in Stockholm has some inherent patriotic bias when assessing the candidates for these awards or perhaps that the Swedes are particularly sensitive to chocolate and even minuscule amounts greatly enhance their cognition he said chocolate create smarties amount of chocolate required to boost the odds of getting a call to travel to Stockholm are unclear said Messerli much chocolate Albert Einstein Marie Curie and other winners of the coveted Nobel Prize actually ate is also unknown factors that give nations greater access to chocolate were omitted from the study

Evolution News and Views  provides original reporting and analysis about the debate over intelligent design and evolution including breaking news about scientific research month announcement of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry should cause design advocates to celebrate We have just seen the biggest prize for science go to three biologists who made a design inference about genetic information Tomas Lindahl Paul Modrich and Aziz Sancar shared the prestigious honor for their work on DNA repair mechanisms course intelligent design was never mentioned in the Nobel Committee announcement either the popular version or the scientific version We know also that the committee assumes that the repair mechanisms came about by a Darwinian process In all likelihood the winners are evolutionists too But think about it their work was about information quality control  a subject related to our new video that came out the very next day after the news The Information Enigma asks three questions  What is information  How do we detect it and  Where does it come from The Nobel announcement suggests a fourth question  How is information maintained  and  were a heady time for molecular biology when the prizewinners were doing their research The realization that life is based on digital information encoded in DNA was only a couple of decades old DNA structure had been revealed by Watson and Crick in  Further work by Crick revealed the molecular basis of the genetic code in the  of DNA bases  Nature Scitable Education Library Watson Crick and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in   their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material  added Their work relied on findings by many other scientists Nature Scitable reminds us that were converging on the fundamental discovery that life is information This month announcement is not the first time the design inference led to a Nobel Prize The NIH Record for instance honors Marshall Warren Nirenberg as  of the genetic code for his work on  genetic code used by virtually all living organisms to translate the information in DNA molecules into protein structure Nirenberg shared the Nobel Prize in  with Robert W Holley and H Gobind Khorana would make no sense obviously if the order of the DNA bases were meaningless Genome sequencing relies on the principle that the precise order of the bases is critical for function principle was becoming known around that time too information can be degraded Erik Stokstad writing in Science describes how these two forces in conflict with each other  information creation and degradation  led Tomas Lindahl to think that something unnatural must be going on in the cell nucleus a postdoc in the late  however Lindahl began to have doubts Samples of RNA in his experiments rapidly degraded when heated Further experiments showed that even under normal conditions DNA quickly suffered enough damage to make life impossible A light bulb went on  had the critical insight says biochemist Bruce Alberts of the University of California San Francisco began to search for enzymes that might repair this unseen damage reason our genetic material does not disintegrate into complete chemical chaos is that a host of molecular systems continuously monitor and repair DNA The Nobel Prize in Chemistry  awards three pioneering scientists who have mapped how several of these repair systems function at a detailed molecular level the DNA molecule is unstable The genome of each cell undergoes thousands of spontaneous changes each day And DNA copying for cell division and multiplication which happens in the body millions of times daily also introduces defects Finally DNA is damaged by ultraviolet light from the sun as well as by industrial pollutants and natural toxins  those in cigarette smoke for example What fights pandemonium are DNA repair mechanisms it fair to say that what is  is the spontaneous degradation of information Mechanisms designed by a mind by contrast can overcome the natural tendency toward  We know from experience that it takes the guidance of goal intelligence to proofread and correct errors in digital code The BBC News aptly calls this process debugging Ever see an unguided debugger of computer code It not necessary to use the phrase  design to recognize it in action Nor is it necessary to know the personal beliefs of the Nobel laureates They made a design inference that what counts Quality control information monitoring error correction systems  these are phrases rich with design concepts glad that three intelligent scientists Lindahl Modrich and Sancar received the world highest scientific honors for uncovering  molecular system that constantly counteracts DNA collapse by what can fairly be called intelligent design Whether or not anyone in fact calls it ID the  Nobel Prize for Chemistry reflects the validity and fruitfulness of the design inference for top scientific research

At UC San Francisco we are driven by the idea that when the best research the best teaching and the best patient care converge we can deliver breakthroughs that help heal the world UC San Francisco we don just treat diseases we treat individuals We put our patients priorities at the center of our care and strive for breakthrough discoveries so that we can improve people lives San Francisco is leading revolutions in health  and those revolutions often start in the lab From basic science to clinical research we are constantly pushing scientific boundaries and earning worldwide recognition for our discoveries UC San Francisco we encourage our students to approach health care issues with critical thinking and a spirit of inquiry As tomorrow health and science leaders in training UCSF students embody our passion for improving the human condition and pushing health care forward News tells stories about the extraordinary work being done here every day and about the dedicated passionate people behind it Explore news stories and press releases or access media resources the leading university focused exclusively on health UC San Francisco is advancing health worldwide Whether you contribute your time or your money you are helping to progress knowledge in medicine and drive scientific breakthroughs to create a healthier world Yamanaka MD PhD a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes  which is affiliated with UCSF  has won the  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of how to transform ordinary adult skin cells into cells that like embryonic stem cells are capable of developing into any cell in the human body shares the prize with John B Gurdon of the Gurdon Institute in Cambridge England prize was awarded for the scientists  that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent who works in both San Francisco and Kyoto is also the director of the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application and a principal investigator at the Institute for Integrated Cell Sciences both at Kyoto University The former orthopedic surgeon trained in biomedical research at Gladstone in the  before returning to San Francisco in  as a Gladstone senior investigator and a UCSF anatomy professor Yamanaka story is a thrilling tale of creative genius focused dedication and successful cross science said R Sanders Williams MD president of Gladstone a leading and independent biomedical organization  traits nurtured during Dr Yamanaka postdoctoral training at Gladstone have led to a breakthrough that has helped propel the San Francisco Bay Area to the forefront of stem cell research Dozens of labs  often supported by organizations such as the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine  and the Roddenberry Foundation  have adopted his technology Altogether hundreds of scientists around the world are employing the  factors and related techniques to search for solutions to a host of relentless illnesses  including those on which Gladstone focuses diseases of the heart diseases of the brain and diseases caused by deadly viruses years ago Yamanaka discovered that by adding just four genes into adult skin cells in mice he could induce the cells to become like embryonic stem cells He called them induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells In  he announced that he had done the same with human adult skin cells stem cells  which are  because they can develop into any type of cell  hold tremendous promise for regenerative medicine in which damaged organs and tissues can be replaced or repaired Many in the science community consider the use of stem cells to be key to the future treatment and eradication of a number of diseases such as diabetes blindness and Parkinson disease the use of embryonic stem cells has long been controversial  which is one reason why Yamanaka discovery of an alternate way to obtain human stem cells without the use of embryos is so important is a wonderful day for Dr Yamanaka UCSF the Gladstone Institutes Kyoto University and the world said UCSF Chancellor Susan Desmond MD MPH  Yamanaka work exemplifies the potential of basic research to transform our understanding of human cell and molecular biology and to use this knowledge to work toward the development of treatments for currently intractable diseases He has opened up a whole new field of discovery and our scientists are working hard to advance the research Yamanaka MD PhDIn addition to avoiding the controversial use of embryonic stem cells iPS cell technology also represents an entirely new platform for fundamental studies of human disease  and the development of therapies to overcome them Rather than using models made in yeast flies or mice for disease research iPS technology allows human stem cells to be created from patients with a specific disease As a result the cells contain a complete set of the genes that resulted in that disease  representing the potential of a far human model for studying disease and testing new drugs and treatments In the future iPS cells could be used in a Petri dish to test both drug safety and efficacy for an individual patient the simplicity of Yamanaka technology was met with skepticism But he made his data and the DNA of his work publicly available to enable any scientist to work with these new cells Within months of the  breakthrough scientists around the world had reproduced and adopted this new approach to generating and studying stem cells impact of Dr Yamanaka discovery is immense said Deepak Srivastava MD who leads stem cell and cardiovascular research at Gladstone  suggested that human adult cells retain a greater ability to be modified than previously thought  and could potentially be altered into whatever cell type might be desired impact can be seen at Gladstone where for example the Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine launched at Gladstone last October with a generous gift from the Roddenberry Foundation  collaborates with Kyoto CIRA on the use of iPS technology in patient therapeutics to improve human health results that Gladstone has announced over the past six months underscore the value of that collaboration In April for example Srivastava announced that his lab had reprogramed cardiac fibroblasts  the heart connective tissue  directly into beating cardiac cells animals June scientists in the lab of Gladstone Investigator Steve Finkbeiner MD PhD announced the creation of a human model of Huntington disease from the skin cells of patients with the disease Earlier that same month scientists in the lab of Gladstone Investigator Yadong Huang MD PhD announced the use of a single genetic factor to transform skin cells into cells that develop on their own into an interconnected functional network of brain cells Both announcements offer new hope in the fight against neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease July Yamanaka own lab at Gladstone discovered that environmental factors critically influence the growth of iPS cells offering newfound understanding of how these cells form These results are crucial for future studies of how iPS cells grow and mature  while all of these research results point to the significance of Yamanaka discovery for the future creation of treatments for some of the world most debilitating diseases  Dr Yamanaka work exemplifies the potential of basic research to transform our understanding of human cell and molecular biology and to use this knowledge to work toward the development of treatments for currently intractable diseases He has opened up a whole new field of discovery and our scientists are working hard to advance the research Chancellor Susan Desmond best part about this prize is that it will bring attention to  and will likely spur  the important stem cell work that scientists around the world are conducting said Yamanaka who is also the L Whittier Foundation Investigator in Stem Cell Biologyat Gladstone  iPS technology is for patients  and the more scientists who build on it the faster we can help those who live with chronic or life diseases up to Monday Nobel prize announcement Yamanaka has received a host of other honors recognizing the importance of his iPS discovery including the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award the Wolf Prize in Medicine the Shaw Prize and the Kyoto Prize for Advanced Technology In  Yamanaka was elected to the U National Academy of Sciences garnering one of the highest honors available for U scientists and engineers In June Yamanaka won the Millennium Technology Award Grand Prize  the world largest and most prominent technology award  along with Linus Torvalds the creator of Linux software will be a speaker at the ISSCR International Symposium on Cellular held at Gladstone later this month on October  and  is an independent and nonprofit biomedical organization dedicated to accelerating the pace

Foundation Executive Director Lars Heikensten told reporters ahead of 


the banquet but he refused to give any details adding  will not notice 


 more than a century the foundation has managed the roughly  


million capital that forms the base for the awards donated in the will 


of dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel But in recent years returns have 


 are in this forever and we should safeguard it  prize said Mr


Heikensten a former Swedish central bank chief known for reducing staff


 during his tenure awards are now worth  million each down from around  million in recent years Still


 Monday evening festivities at Stockholm City Hall  itself 


decorated with  kg of gold leaf  were never likely to be spartan


 of a menu which included Joseph Perrier Cuv Royale Champagne and 


pheasant with chanterelle mushrooms were only revealed minutes before 


the food was served Guests at the event touted as one of the world 


biggest set dinners ate from some  pieces of porcelain using 


 items of silverware and drank from  glasses the Nobel Banquet was held in Sweden the European Union collected this year Nobel Peace Price at a separate ceremony held in Oslo NorwayContrast The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo also held yesterday appeared a more austere event by comparisonGuests danced to music including Abba hits played by a live band after the sumptuous meal European Union was awarded this year Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo last night  a win which raised a few eyebrows when it was announced back in October heard Nobel Committee President Thorbjoern Jagland praise the EU role in transforming a European  of war into a  of peace the announcement of had caused surprise and controversy in the midst of one of the EU worst crises and at a time of deep  albeit non  rifts between major member states Minister David Cameron stayed away from yesterday event  one of six EU leaders who decided not to attend deputy Nick Clegg got his own day of peace attending alone to represent the UK in the splendour of the Nobel Institute in Oslo


 Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel established the Nobel prizes more than  years ago in  with the following prize categories physics chemistry physiology or medicine and peace


  years later those categories have essentially remained the same except for the addition of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science known as the Economics Prize   prize for literature was added in 


 science has catapulted forward The age of computing has come about as have drastic changes in Earth environment and the way humans interact with the world


 conducted a poll of an international group of scientists from a range of disciplines to determine what types of categories modern scientists feel are missing from the prizes We asked the scientists to consider whether the existing prizes accurately represent science today and if not what categories they think should be added   Noblest Nobel Prize Winners of All Time


 answers varied almost as widely as the disciplines surveyed but there was also some overlap among the  responses LiveScience received


 many wondered why there is not a prize in mathematics


 is the international language foundation and building block of almost all societal advances argued Jennifer Irish a coastal engineer from Virginia Tech


 reason behind the omission of what many consider a shoe prize category remains a mystery Some say that Nobel wanted his prizes to be in areas that clearly benefit humanity and that he did not consider math to fit this bill Other rumors suggest that the decision might have had something to do with a secret affair between Nobel lover and a famous mathematician but this remains speculative


 in second place after mathematics were technology social sciences Those who voted for technology argued that advancements in just the past several decades let alone the last  years have drastically changed the way we live on Earth


 and information science  obviously revolutionized life since the original categories were established and seem to have no natural home in the existing categories said Daniel Lidar professor of electrical engineering and chemistry at the University of Southern California and director and co of the USC Center for Quantum Information Science  Technology


 who voted for social sciences suggested that this has always been an important field of science and simply cannot be shoehorned into existing categories as other more tangential sciences can


 most obvious omission are all the social sciences said Anthony Leiserowitz director of the Yale Project on Climate Change  social sciences are vitally important in understanding human nature the human condition and how to construct a more sustainable world


 the other categories suggested were engineering geoscience ecology sustainability climate science and behavioral science


 others argued that the prize categories are fine as they are and should remain the same in perpetuity


 Nobel Prizes need to continue to reflect theoretical changes in fundamental science and not shift toward any applied sciences in response to trends of the time said Michael Dee an archaeologist at the University of Oxford  the applied sciences including the research that I do stem from developments in fundamental theory


 Krauss a theoretical physicist at Arizona State University agrees that the prizes are fine as they stand now New areas in biophysics neuroscience and genomics can be included in medicine chemistry and physics New areas in physics such as biophysics and informatics can be included in physics or medicine or chemistry Krauss said   Biggest Unsolved Mysteries in Physics


 Saito an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts is also fine with the fact that there is and may never be an earth science category that his work would fall within


 a sense it might be a good thing Saito said  have a culture of extensive cooperation in ocean science due to our field programs and perhaps it would be made more difficult to maintain that culture if scientists were trying to edge each other out to win a fancy award


 are some additional comments that we received in our survey


 Alexander Weigand taxonomist at Geothe University in Frankfurt Germany


 I feel the actual Nobel Prize categories are very delimited from each other Although this is definitely OK and results from their origin some new ones could comprise interdisciplinary categories such as  and  giving credit to inventors and discoverers solving urgent daily problems Something similar as already established in the Right Livelihood Award or  Nobel Prize


 science Ten years ago I would have advocated a prize in psychology but now I would put it more broadly in behavioral science Several psychologists have been awarded Nobel Prizes but only after being shoe into other fields such as Economics or Medicine So there is not a lack of  talent and there is not a lack of work being done in the behavioral sciences that is worthy of Nobels


 Graeme Clark ecologist at University of New South Wales in Sydney Australia


 consequences of human activities  climate change species extinctions are becoming increasingly prominent in the scientific and public domain and the field of ecology is critical in understanding these changes and searching for solutions


 Christof Koch a neuroscientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle


 much exciting work is happening at the intersection of natural science and mathematics complexity and how to measure it  the fractal nature of reality machine learning mechanics and information theory the theory of evolution and information theory and so on  The  Most Beautiful Mathematical Equations


 Dan Kruger professor of evolutionary psychology at University of Michigan


 would change or Medicine to  Sciences  to  Sciences  and  to  Sciences also maybe create a new more applied category for    maybe change to  Keep  we need as much as we can get


 Jim Moum an oceanographer at Oregon State University


 if you look at Nature of Science articles  scientific journals over the past couple of decades papers involving climate science have been published I think with increasing regularity This is a topical subject involving the physical chemical and biological responses of and feedbacks with the fluid earth  and ocean I think there is only on Nobel Prize to date that is related to this  chemistry It seems this is a topic worth of greater recognition


 Ben Kear palaeobiologist at Uppsala University in Sweden


 Nobel Prizes are classically geared towards applied sciences and politically aim for commercial impact Consequently basic research which provides the fundamental framework of science is usually overlooked In my opinion though creating new categories is not the answer A better solution would be to channel the funds expended upon high profile publicity ventures like the Nobel Prize into more stable and long scientific research across the board Ultimately this will produce far more in terms of real outcomes generate more media profile and be of greater benefit for not only scientists but also society as a whole


 John Skrentny sociologist at University of California San Diego


 is long overdue to expand the number of social science Nobels or simply to make the existing Nobel for  Science rather than  Sciences This is because there is no solid justification for a narrow focus on economic sciences While that field superficially may look more  than other social sciences because it relies on math more is no more like a natural or physical science than are political science or sociology

Since  the Nobel Prize in Literature  Nobelpriset i litteratur has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel produced  the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction  Swedish den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framst verket i en idealisk riktning Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy here  refers to an author work as a whole The Swedish Academy decides who if anyone will receive the prize in any given year The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in  the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry Nobel Prize in Physics Nobel Peace Prize and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine choice of emphasis on idealism in his criteria for the Nobel Prize in Literature has led to recurrent controversy In the original Swedish the word idealisk translates as either  or  In the early twentieth century the Nobel Committee interpreted the intent of the will strictly For this reason they did not award certain world authors of the time such as James Joyce Leo Tolstoy Anton Chekhov Marcel Proust Henrik Ibsen and Henry James More recently the wording has been more liberally interpreted Thus the prize is now awarded both for lasting literary merit and for evidence of consistent idealism on some significant level In recent years this means a kind of idealism championing human rights on a broad scale Hence the award is now arguably more political Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism in recent years for its handling of the award Some critics contend that many well writers have not been awarded the prize or even been nominated and others contend that some well recipients do not deserve it There have also been controversies involving alleged political interests relating to the nomination process and ultimate selection of some of the recent literary laureates Some such as Indian academic Sabaree Mitra have noted that though the Nobel Prize in Literature is significant and tends to overshadow other awards it is  the only benchmark of literary excellence Nobel stipulated in his last will and testament that his money be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the  benefit on mankind in physics chemistry peace physiology or medicine and literature Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime the last was written a little over a year before he died and signed at the Swedish Club in Paris on  November  Nobel bequeathed  of his total assets  Swedish kronor  million  million in  to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes Due to the level of scepticism surrounding the will it was not until April   that the Storting  Parliament approved it The executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel fortune and organize the prizes members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved The prize organisations followed the Karolinska Institutet on June  the Swedish Academy on June  and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on June  The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded In  the Nobel Foundation newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II According to Nobel will the Royal Swedish Academy were to award the Prize in Literature year the Swedish Academy sends out requests for nominations of candidates for the Nobel Prize in Literature Members of the Academy members of literature academies and societies professors of literature and language former Nobel literature laureates and the presidents of writers organizations are all allowed to nominate a candidate It is not permitted to nominate oneself of requests are sent out each year and as of  about  proposals are returned These proposals must be received by the Academy by  February after which they are examined by the Nobel Committee By April the Academy narrows the field to around twenty candidates By May a short list of five names is approved by the Committee The subsequent four months are then spent in reading and reviewing the works of the five candidates In October members of the Academy vote and the candidate who receives more than half of the votes is named the Nobel laureate in Literature No one can get the prize without being on the list at least twice thus many of the same authors reappear and are reviewed repeatedly over the years The academy is master of thirteen languages but when a candidate is shortlisted from an unknown language they call on translators and oath experts to provide samples of that writer Other elements of the process are similar to that of other Nobel Prizes Literature Nobel Prize laureate earns a gold medal a diploma bearing a citation and a sum of money The amount of money awarded depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation that year If a prize is awarded to more than one laureate the money is either split evenly among them or for three laureates it may be divided into a half and two quarters If a prize is awarded jointly to two or more laureates the money is split among them


The prize money of the Nobel Prize has been fluctuating since its inauguration but as of  it stands at kr  US previously it was kr This was not the first time the prize was decreased with a nominal value of kr in    in  SEK the nominal value has been as low as kr  in  SEK in  it has been uphill or stable since then peaking at an SEK value of  in  laureate is also invited to give a lecture during  Week in Stockholm the highlight is the prize ceremony and banquet on December  It is the richest literary prize in the world by a large margin Nobel Prize medals minted by Myntverket in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since  are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse  side of the medal The Nobel Prize medals for Physics Chemistry Physiology or Medicine and Literature have identical obverses showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death  Nobel portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics but with a slightly different design The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design The medal for the Nobel Prize in Literature was designed by Erik Lindberg laureates receive a Diploma directly from the King of Sweden Each Diploma is uniquely designed by the prize institutions for the laureate that receives it The Diploma contains a picture and text that states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize recipients of the Nobel Prize in Literature are difficult to predict as nominations are kept secret for fifty years until they are publicly available at The Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Literature Currently only nominations submitted between  and  are available for public viewing This secrecy has led to speculation about the next Nobel laureate about the rumours circling around the world about certain people being nominated for the Nobel Prize this year  Well either it just a rumour or someone among the invited nominators has leaked information Since the nominations are kept secret for  years you have to wait until then to find out to Professor G Malmqvist of the Swedish Academy Chinese writer Shen Congwen was to have been awarded the  Nobel Prize in Literature had he not suddenly died that year  to  the committee was characterised by an interpretation of the  direction stated in Nobel will as  lofty and sound idealism needed That caused Leo Tolstoy Henrik Ibsen  Zola and Mark Twain to be rejected Also many believe Sweden historic antipathy towards Russia is the reason neither Tolstoy nor Anton Chekhov was awarded the prize needed During World War I and its immediate aftermath the committee adopted a policy of neutrality favouring writers from non countries August Strindberg was repeatedly bypassed by the committee but holds the singular distinction of being awarded an Anti Prize conferred by popular acclaim and national subscription and presented to him in  by future prime minister Hjalmar Branting James Joyce wrote the books that rank  and  on the Modern Library  Best Novels Ulysses and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man respectively but Joyce never won as biographer Gordon Barker wrote  prize was just out of Joyce reach academy considered Czech writer Karel Capek War With the Newts too offensive to the German government He also declined to suggest some noncontroversial publication that could be cited as an example of his work stating  you for the good will but I have already written my doctoral dissertation He was thus denied the prize to Swedish Academy archives studied by the

times especially in  and   long as he does not come back to novel Thus Camus was awarded the prize in  attribute W H Auden not being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature to errors in his translation of  Peace Prize laureate Dag Hammarskj V  and to statements that Auden made during a Scandinavian lecture tour suggesting that Hammarskj was like Auden homosexual  John Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature The selection was heavily criticized and described as  of the Academy biggest mistakes in one Swedish newspaper The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose  talent is in his best books watered down by tenth philosophising adding  think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer  whose significance influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age Steinbeck himself when asked if he deserved the Nobel on the day of the announcement replied  no In   years later the Nobel Prize opened its archives and it was revealed that Steinbeck was a  choice among a shortlist consisting of Steinbeck British authors Robert Graves and Lawrence Durrell French dramatist Jean Anouilh and Danish author Karen Blixen The declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot  aren any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation wrote committee member Henry Olsson  Jean Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature but he declined it stating that  is not the same thing if I sign Jean Sartre or if I sign Jean Sartre Nobel Prize laureate A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution even if it takes place in the most honorable form dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn the  prize laureate did not attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm for fear that the USSR would prevent his return afterwards  works there were circulated in samizdat form needed After the Swedish government refused to honor Solzhenitsyn with a public award ceremony and lecture at its Moscow embassy Solzhenitsyn refused the award altogether commenting that the conditions set by the Swedes  preferred a private ceremony were  insult to the Nobel Prize itself Solzhenitsyn did not accept the award and prize money until  December  after he was deported from the Soviet Union  Graham Greene Vladimir Nabokov and Saul Bellow were considered but rejected in favor of a joint award for Swedish authors Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson both members of the Swedish Academy at the time and unknown outside their home country Bellow received the Nobel Prize in Literature in  neither Greene nor Nabokov was awarded it writer Jorge Luis Borges was nominated for the Prize several times but as Edwin Williamson Borges biographer states the Academy did not award it to him most likely because of his support of certain Argentine and Chilean right military dictators including Augusto Pinochet which according to T review of Williamson Borges A Life had complex social and personal contexts Borges failure to receive the Nobel Prize for his support of these right dictators contrasts with the Committee honoring writers who openly supported controversial left dictatorships including Joseph Stalin in the cases of Sartre and Pablo Neruda and Fidel Castro in the case of Gabriel Garc M award to Italian performance artist Dario Fo in  was initially considered  lightweight by some critics as he was seen primarily as a performer and Catholic organizations saw the award to Fo as controversial as he had previously been censured by the Roman Catholic Church The Vatican newspaper L Romano expressed surprise at Fo selection for the prize commenting that  the prize to someone who is also the author of questionable works is beyond all imagination Salman Rushdie and Arthur Miller had been strongly favoured to receive the Prize but the Nobel organisers were later quoted as saying that they would have been  predictable too popular Jos Cela willingly offered his services as an informer for Franco regime and had moved voluntarily from Madrid to Galicia during the Spanish Civil War in order to join the rebel forces there an article by Miguel Angel Villena Between Fear and Impunity which compiled commentaries by Spanish novelists on the noteworthy silence of the older generation of Spanish novelists on the Francoist pasts of public intellectuals appeared below a photograph of Cela during the Nobel ceremony in Stockholm in  choice of the  laureate Elfriede Jelinek was protested by a member of the Swedish Academy Knut Ahnlund who had not played an active role in the Academy since  Ahnlund resigned alleging that selecting Jelinek had caused  damage to the reputation of the award selection of Harold Pinter for the Prize in  was delayed for a couple of days apparently due to Ahnlund resignation and led to renewed speculations about there being a  element in the Swedish Academy awarding of the Prize Although Pinter was unable to give his controversial Nobel Lecture in person because of ill health he delivered it from a television studio on video projected on screens to an audience at the Swedish Academy in Stockholm His comments have been the source of much commentary and debate The issue of their  stance was also raised in response to the awards of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Orhan Pamuk and Doris Lessing in  and  respectively prize focus on Europeans and Swedes in particular has been the subject of criticism even from Swedish newspapers The majority of laureates have been European with Sweden itself receiving more prizes than all of Asia as well as all of Latin America In  Horace Engdahl then the permanent secretary of the Academy declared that  still is the center of the literary world and that  US is too isolated too insular They don translate enough and don really participate in the big dialogue of literature  Engdahl replacement Peter Englund rejected this sentiment  most language areas  there are authors that really deserve and could get the Nobel Prize and that goes for the United States and the Americas as well and acknowledged the Eurocentric nature of the award saying that  think that is a problem We tend to relate more easily to literature written in Europe and in the European tradition American critics are known to object that those from their own country like Philip Roth Thomas Pynchon and Cormac McCarthy have been overlooked as have Latin Americans such as Jorge Luis Borges Julio Cort and Carlos Fuentes while in their place Europeans lesser to that continent have triumphed The  award to Herta M previously little outside Germany but many times named favorite for the Nobel Prize re the viewpoint that the Swedish Academy was biased and Eurocentric the  prize was awarded to Mario Vargas Llosa a native of Peru in South America When the  prize was awarded to the eminent Swedish poet Tomas Transtr permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Peter Englund said the prize was not decided based on politics describing such a notion as  for dummies The Swedish Academy awarded the next two prizes to non Chinese author Mo Yan and Canadian short story writer Alice Munro French writer Patrick Modiano win in  renewed questions of Eurocentrism when asked by The Wall Street Journal  no American this year yet again Why is that Englund reminded Americans of the Canadian origins of the previous year winner the Academy desire for literary quality and the impossibility of rewarding everyone who deserves the prize the history of the Nobel Prize in Literature many literary achievements were overlooked The literary historian Kjell Espmark admitted that  to the early prizes the censure of bad choices and blatant omissions is often justified Tolstoy Ibsen and Henry James should have been rewarded instead of for instance Sully Prudhomme Eucken and Heyse There are omissions which are beyond the control of the Nobel Committee such as the early death of an author as was the case with Marcel Proust Italo Calvino and Roberto Bola According to Kjell Espmark  main works of Kafka Cavafy and Pessoa were not published until after their deaths and the true dimensions of Mandelstam poetry were revealed above all in the unpublished poems that his wife saved from extinction and gave to the world long after he had perished in his Siberian exile British novelist Tim Parks ascribed the never controversy surrounding the decisions of the Nobel Committee to the  silliness of the prize and our own foolishness at taking it seriously and noted that   sixteen Swedish nationals will have a certain credibility when weighing up works of Swedish literature but what group could ever really get its mind round the infinitely varied work of scores of different traditions And why should we ask them to do that Nobel Prize in Literature is not the only literary prize for which all nationalities are eligible Other notable international literary prizes include the Neustadt International Prize for Literature the Franz Kafka Prize and the Man Booker International Prize In contrast to the Nobel Prize in Literature the Franz Kafka Prize and the Man Booker International Prize the Neustadt International Prize is awarded biennially The journalist Hephzibah Anderson has noted that the Man Booker International Prize  fast becoming the more significant award appearing an ever more competent alternative to the Nobel The Man Booker International Prize  one writer overall contribution to fiction on the world stage and  literary excellence as its sole focus Established in  it is not yet possible to analyze its importance on potential future Nobel Prize in Literature laureates Only Alice Munro  has been awarded with both However some winners of the Man Booker International Prize such as Ismail Kadare  and Philip Roth  are considered contenders for the Nobel Prize in Literature The Neustadt International Prize for Literature is regarded as one of the most prestigious international literary prizes often referred to as the American equivalent to the Nobel Prize Like the Nobel or the Man Booker International Prize it is awarded not for any one work but for an entire body of work It is frequently seen as an indicator of who may be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature Gabriel Garc M  Neustadt  Nobel Czeslaw Milosz  Neustadt  Nobel Octavio Paz  Neustadt  Nobel Tomas Transtr  Neustadt  Nobel were first awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature before being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature award of note is the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award  Prince of Asturias Award in Letters During the first years of its existence it was almost exclusively awarded to writers in the Spanish language but in more recent times writers in other languages have been awarded as well Writers who have won both the Asturias Award in Letters and the Nobel Prize in Literature include Camilo Jos Cela G Grass Doris Lessing and Mario Vargas Llosa America Award in Literature which does not include a monetary prize presents itself as an alternative to the Nobel Prize in Literature To date Harold Pinter and Jos Saramago are the only writers to have received both the America Award and the Nobel Prize in Literature are also prizes for honouring the lifetime achievement of writers in specific languages like the Miguel de Cervantes Prize  Spanish language established in  and the Cam Prize  Portuguese language established in  Nobel laureates who were also awarded the Miguel de Cervantes Prize include Octavio Paz  Cervantes  Nobel Mario Vargas Llosa  Cervantes  Nobel and Camilo Jos Cela  Cervantes  Nobel Jos Saramago is the only author to receive both the Cam Prize  and the Nobel Prize  to date Hans Christian Andersen Award is sometimes referred to as  Little Nobel The award has earned this appellation since in a similar manner to the Nobel Prize in Literature it recognizes the lifetime achievement of writers though the Andersen Award focuses on a single category of literary works  literature Nobel death the Nobel Foundation was set up to carry out the provisions of his will and to administer his funds In his will he had stipulated that four different institutions Swedish and one Norwegian award the prizes From Stockholm the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences confers the prizes for physics chemistry and economics the Karolinska Institute confers the prize for physiology or medicine and the Swedish Academy confers the prize for literature The Norwegian Nobel Committee based in Oslo confers the prize for peace The Nobel Foundation is the legal owner and functional administrator of the funds and serves as the joint administrative body of the prize institutions but it is not concerned with the prize deliberations or decisions which rest exclusively with the four institutions Nobel Prize consists of a gold medal a diploma bearing a citation and a sum of money the amount of which depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation  sum of  accompanied each prize in  A Nobel Prize is either given entirely to one person divided equally between two persons or shared by three persons In the latter case each of the three persons can receive a one share of the prize or two together can receive a one

increasingly lethal uses of his inventions in war Bernhard Nobel was born in Stockholm in  and four years later his family moved to Russia His father ran a successful St Petersburg factory that built explosive mines and other military equipment Educated in Russia Paris and the United States Alfred Nobel proved a brilliant chemist When his father business faltered after the end of the Crimean War Nobel returned to Sweden and set up a laboratory to experiment with explosives In  he invented a way to control the detonation of nitroglycerin a highly volatile liquid that had been recently discovered but was previously regarded as too dangerous for use Two years later Nobel invented the blasting cap an improved detonator that inaugurated the modern use of high explosives Previously the most dependable explosive was black powder a form of gunpowder remained dangerous however and in  Nobel nitroglycerin factory blew up killing his younger brother and several other people Searching for a safer explosive Nobel discovered in  that the combination of nitroglycerin and a porous substance called kieselguhr produced a highly explosive mixture that was much safer to handle and use Nobel christened his invention  for the Greek word dynamis meaning  Securing patents on dynamite Nobel acquired a fortune as humanity put his invention to use in construction and warfare  Nobel created a more powerful form of dynamite blasting gelatin and in  introduced ballistite a smokeless nitroglycerin powder Around that time one of Nobel brothers died in France and French newspapers printed obituaries in which they mistook him for Alfred One headline read  merchant of death is dead Alfred Nobel in fact had pacifist tendencies and in his later years apparently developed strong misgivings

Purdue President France A C at left talks Wednesday   with Purdue University professor Ei Negishi Nobel Laureate in chemistry at his home in West Lafayette Ind Negishi is the Herbert C Brown Distinguished Professor of Chemistry  University photo Hancock imageWEST LAFAYETTE Ind  A Purdue University chemist on Wednesday   was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for creating a method to build complex organic molecules necessary for numerous purposes from pharmaceutical manufacturing to electronics Negishi   Na the Herbert C Brown Distinguished Professor of Chemistry was a co of the prize with scientists Richard Heck of the University of Delaware in Newark and Akira Suzuki of Hokkaido University in Sapporo Japan They will share the  million award President France A C said the university was proud that Negishi and his work were recognized by the Nobel Prize committee Negishi work in organic molecules is groundbreaking and inspiring especially in its application for improving medicines and impacting lives C said  are very proud that he has been bestowed with this highest honor We congratulate professor Negishi and celebrate this great accomplishment developed metal reactions called palladium cross that allow for easy and efficient synthesis of complex organic compounds Examples of applications include drug manufacturing fluorescent marking that has been essential for DNA sequencing and creating materials for thin LED displays discovered catalytic reactions using a number of transition metals that allow various organic compounds to be synthesized widely efficiently and selectively for use in fields ranging from medicine to materials development His work has resulted in dramatically reducing the cost of using such metals like palladium in the synthesis are not lost as they spur a chemical reaction they are recycled and can be used over and over again he said  transition metals are very expensive but when they can be used millions to billions of times it dramatically reduces the cost and makes the mass manufacturing of special complex materials practical likened the innovation to playing with a LEGO game altering the building blocks of molecules and using transition metals as catalysts to promote the reactions needed for the synthesis found catalysts and created reactions that allow complex organic compounds to in effect snap together with other compounds to more economically and efficiently build desired materials he said  can be combined to make things of any shape size and color and our reactions make this a possibility for organic compounds The National Institute of General Medical Sciences  which is part of the National Institutes of Health has supported Negishi work since  methodology has vastly improved the possibilities to create sophisticated chemicals and has broad implications for the medical electronic and agricultural fields said NIH director Francis S Collins  has already allowed chemists to synthesize compounds to fight the herpes virus HIV and colon cancer director Jeremy M Berg said Negishi work focuses on the carbon bonds that form the backbones of organic molecules  bonds are like the frame of a house  you have to get them right for the structure to be functional and useful Berg said  developing a more precise and efficient method for making these bonds Dr Negishi created a remarkably powerful tool for synthesizing a wide range of useful chemicals Nobel Prize was bestowed primarily on the strength of  seminal papers published from  to  said Negishi who came to Purdue in  as a postdoctoral researcher under the late Herbert C Brown who won the Nobel Prize in  is one of two of Brown students to win the prize this year Co Suzuki also studied under Brown Kevin Gurney a Purdue professor of earth and atmospheric sciences and Otto Doering a professor of agricultural economics were part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that shared the  Peace Prize Al Gore grew up in Japan and received a bachelor degree in organic chemistry from the University of Tokyo in  He moved to the United States in  to attend graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania as a Fulbright scholar earning a doctorate in organic chemistry in  Negishi went to Syracuse University in  where he was an assistant professor and then an associate professor before returning to Purdue in  was appointed the H C Brown Distinguished Professor of Chemistry in  and has won various awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship the A R Day Award a Chemical Society of Japan Award an American Chemical Society Organometallic Chemistry Award and a Humboldt Senior Researcher Award Negishi has authored more than  publications including two books one of which is the Handbook of Organopalladium Chemistry for Organic Synthesis Collectively these publications have been cited more than  times Negishi has been cited in Marquis Who Who in America and Marquis Who Who in the

The Nobel Peace Prize is the most prestigious award of its kind but after criticism over the committee politicisation and questions raised over recent winners is the prize losing its credibility Tawakkol Karman one of the three Nobel Peace Prize winners in  many presidents or nation leaders hoping for re a previous Nobel Peace Prize win might form the bedrock of their campaign But for Barack Obama who was awarded the prize in  his campaign team would rather it was forgotten about Obama was less than nine months into his presidency and was commander of the US army in Afghanistan and Iraq He went on to approve military intervention in Libya and under his presidency there has been a huge escalation in the use of drone attacks mainly in Pakistan prize was awarded for Mr Obama  efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples and yet the speech he gave on receiving the prize was a defence of the right to go to war gave it someone on the premise that he would do great things says Iver Neumann professor of international relations at the London School of Economics which was  bit of a blunder he adds  articulating wider public opinion Another controversial decision was made in  when Henry Kissinger was awarded the prize for brokering a settlement in Vietnam while the war was still going on prize is awarded by politicians who by definition do not  have the historical and social context you would find in other  committees It shouldn surprise us that they awarded it to people like  themselves Iver Neumann LSE international relations professorBy no means does such controversy surround every winner Aung San Suu Kyi and Nelson Mandela are just some of the laureates who are still considered international peacemakers The three women from Liberia and Yemen who won last year did so because they contributed to the  struggle for the safety of women and for women rights said the committee and the decision was praised for highlighting their work and the plight of both countries the relevance and politicisation of the Nobel Peace Prize has recently been called into question  a bit stale says Professor Neumann  you think about the amount of great activity and discourse on war and peace the Nobel peace prize does not come to mind committee has obviously decided that isn the point of the prize contendersIn a surprise move the European Union was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in  Below is a selection of the main contenders shortlisted either by the director of the Peace Research Institute in Oslo or by Paddy Power bookmakers on  October before the prize was announced   Gene Sharp analyst and author who inspired non uprisings   Sima Samar former Afghan Women Minister and human rights advocate  Julian Assange Wikileaks founder  Memorial Human Rights Centre RussiaPolitician committeePart of the reason the prize is not as relevant as it could be is because the awarding committee is made up of politicians says Professor Neumann  Alfred Nobel will specifies that the committee be made up of five people chosen by the Norwegian government Under current practice those put forward are representatives from parties in the government who then chose between individuals or groups recommended to them from across the world critics of this process argue that politicians are not best placed to choose the world greatest peacemaker   prize does something that none of the other prizes do It uses practitioners to deal out the prize rather than experts says Professor Neumann who points to the literature prize as an example which is awarded by scholars  Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by politicians who by definition do not have the historical and social context that you would find in other committees It shouldn surprise us that they award it to people like themselves two members of the committee were replaced last year there was a debate in Norway over how they should be chosen but the Swedish government decided not to change the process Kristian Berg Harpviken director of the Peace Research Institute in Oslo which speculates on possible winners agrees that the prize might be better served if the committee had a different make  is very often made up of senior politicians who have retired and party membership is almost a necessity he told Channel  News concerns This also has implications for international relations in that although the committee is independent it is strongly associated with the Norwegian government So much so that China froze diplomatic ties with Norway in  when the committee gave the prize to dissident Liu Xiaobo accusing Norway of interfering in its internal affairs immense controversy is simply evidence to how much the prize is  valued There is lots of debate in some years but it has been for a long time the world  prestigious prize Kristian Berg Harpviken Peace Research Institute directorWhile he does not agree with the Chinese government  fact that the Nobel committee is such a close reflection of the political spectrum does give some weight to the Chinese argument Professor Harpviken told Channel  News prime minister Torbj Jagland the current committee chair is also secretary at the Council of Europe which represents  member countries including Russia and this has been cited as a possible reason that the growing movement against the erosion of human rights in Russia has not been selected in the past contendersHis allegiances may be tested this year however The list of potential Russian laureates according to the Peace Research Institute includes Svetlana Gannushkina and the human rights centre Memorial that she helps to lead as well as the radio station Ekho Moskvy and its editor Alexei Venediktov despite the controversy and debate that inevitably surrounds the annual prize giving there is no doubt that the Nobel Peace Prize still garners a huge amount of international attention and casts the winner into the spotlight  whether they like it or not immense controversy is simply evidence to how much the prize is valued There is lots of debate in some years and considerable criticism but it has for a long time and remains the world prestigious prize says Professor Harpviken   think it a prize that has a value because it does help to shine light on issues or conflicts that are not in people attention Up

Duke and UNC professors win the ultimate science prizeResearch of theirs and a Swedish scientist advances DNA repairIt may lead to cancer treatmentsBY THE EDITORIAL BOARDIt a name that means the ultimate the pinnacle of achievement in any field And in a scientist career the Nobel Prize is a multimillion shot This year a scientist from Duke and one from UNC Hill are sharing the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with a Swedish scientist Their work independently focused on DNA repair something they have studied and advanced for decades and a field that one day could lead toward cell repair for cancer treatment that about as technical as any layperson should get Paul Modrich  of Duke Aziz Sancar  of UNC Hill and Tomas Lindahl  of Sweden work in a world understood by a relative few But they understand it and their tireless research will one day better the lives of humankind Sounds like a worthy argument for a Nobel Prize Sancar a U national shared some of his excitement with his country  he said   friends been asking over the years and I was tired of hearing  are you going to get the Nobel Prize so I glad for my country as well For his part Modrich vacationing in New Hampshire didn care to grab the spotlight His assistant at Duke said that all the lab workers were thrilled and that  couldn have happened to a nicer guy Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said of the prize  work has provided fundamental knowledge of how a living cell functions and is for instance used for the development of new cancer treatments inventor Alfred Nobel made the prizes possible in the late  century They awarded in the sciences literature and for peace Recipients go to Sweden to accept and are required to make presentations in their fields Nobel Prize in Chemistry is one of the most difficult to win and like the other prizes  envisioned by Nobel himself is awarded not just for technical achievement but for significant contributions to the betterment of the human race They been given for example for specific medical treatments and for things such as the development of X short this achievement is nothing short of spectacular and a monument to individual determination  one recognizes when the research of all three is put together decades of time in laboratories and is shared in a way with the institutions that helped to facilitate the research two Triangle universities separated by a mere  miles in this case raise their hands together For humankind and with the hope that one day the achievements in this Nobel Prize will lead to miracles

 shall be awarded to those persons who during the previous year have rendered the greatest service to mankind Nobel last will   the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science has been awarded to more than two dozen eminent economists including Paul Samuelson Friedrich Hayek Milton Friedman James Tobin and Robert Solow Last year the winner was Robert Lucas the Chicago economist who developed the rational expectations theory winning the Nobel Prize reflects the growing dominance of free economics in the profession In fact economists from the University of Chicago received the award in five of the past six years The prize established by the Bank of Sweden is awarded by a six committee headed by Assar Lindbeck who has gradually grown more conservative over time Economist Robert Kuttner bemoans the fact that several prominent Keynesians were ignored by the Nobel committee during their lifetimes Joan Robinson Nicholas Kaldor and Sir Roy Harrod  Week November   there any free economists who failed to receive the Nobel Prize I asked several colleagues to name their favorite deceased economist who was still alive in  why that economist deserved the award and what major works should be cited Their choices were as follows von MisesLudwig von Mises  the pre Austrian economist was everyone first choice Of his many original contributions three stand out the theory of the business cycle the socialist calculation debate and methodology Most important works Theory of Money and Credit  Socialism  and Human Action   N RothbardMurray N Rothbard  the libertarian iconoclast who popularized Misesian economics in America was nearly everyone second choice He made original contributions in welfare economics and monopoly and tax theory but was best known for his remarkable ability to write clearly and profoundly about money business cycles and government policy Major works Man Economy and State  America Great Depression  and Power and Market  His booklet What Has the Government Done to Our Money has probably had the greatest influence of all Several colleagues also mentioned his last great work a two history Economic Thought Before Adam Smith and Classical Economics  Elgar  H HuttWilliam H Hutt  a classical economist who for half a century taught at the University of Cape Town was frequently mentioned as a third candidate Hutt major contribution was in labor economics wherein he argued that persistent unemployment was due to above wage rates imposed by government regulations He was a long critic of Keynesian economics and apartheid in South Africa Major works The Theory of Idle Resources  Keynesianism Retrospect and Prospect  and Economics of the Colour Bar  fellow economists also recommended several other names Oskar Morgenstern for his Theory of Games and Economic Behavior  co by John von Neumann and On the Accuracy of Economic Observations  Gottfried Haberler for his Prosperity and Depression  and his exposition of the Austrian theory of the trade cycle Frank Knight for his Risk Uncertainty and Profit  Jacob Viner for his history of economic thought and the development of cost theory in The Long View and the Short  and Henry Hazlitt for his Failure of the  Economics  several free economists felt that Joan Robinson  merited the Nobel Prize not for her politics but for her scientific contributions such as The Economics of Imperfect Competition  In  she was widely expected to win the Nobel Prize but was ultimately denied it because of her extreme political views and her admiration of Mao China and Kim Il Sung North Korea Nobel Really WantedIn reviewing the winners of the Nobel Prize I wonder how well the Nobel committee has matched Alfred Nobel original desires His last will and testament created five prizes  chemistry physiology or medicine literature and peace all for actions that were to benefit mankind in a very practical sense much like his invention of dynamite Dynamite is not used solely as a tool of war it plays a valuable role in mining construction and transportation Nobel last will is filled with words such as      and  In sum scientists authors and activists who have improved the lot of mankind deserve the Nobel Prize the past the Swedish academies have given prizes to outstanding citizens who have rendered the  services to mankind Roentgen for discovering x Marconi for developing the wireless telegraph Banting for isolating insulin and Fleming for discovering penicillin Yet at the same time the Swedish Royal Academy has awarded many obscure and sometimes minimal contributors while ignoring many noteworthy individuals In literature for example Mark Twain and Leo Tolstoy never received Nobel honors science the following were overlooked Thomas Edison for the electric light bulb August and Louis Lumiere for motion pictures Willis Haviland Carrier for air Orville and Wilbur Wright for the airplane Henry Ford for mass production George Washington Carver for agricultural techniques Vladimir Zworykin and Isaac Shoenberg for television Robert Watson for radar Frank Whittle and Hans Pabst von Ohain for the jet engine Chester Carlson for xerography Howard Aiken John P Eckert Jr and John W Mauchly for the digital computer Jonas Salk for the polio vaccine and Ted Hoff for the microprocessor  thank Michael H Hart author of The One Hundred A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History   for providing this wish list of potential Nobel winners Surely these men have made a significant difference in our way of life and standard of living Nobel for W Deming keeping with the spirit of Nobel the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science ought to expand its universe from high theory to applied science If the Nobel Prize can go to finance theorists such as Harry Markowitz perhaps it could be extended to management theorists statisticians and entrepreneurs For example surely W Edwards Deming  deserved the Nobel Prize in economics Although not a trained economist his dynamic  research approach developed in post Japan revolutionized the world of production consumption and job creation as much as any Friedman or Samuelson

Nobel prize Sir Andre Geim has told ITV News the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union is  scary physicist said he couldn predict how things would be in  or  years time but warned it was  short to rely on hope rather than scientific facts Sir Andre who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in  for his work on graphene is one of thirteen laureates to sign a letter to the Daily Telegraph saying British research would be put in jeopardy by a vote to leave the EU a prominent Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith has suggested the scientists may have been leaned on by EU bureaucrats saying  threats are complete rubbish and scientists shouldn listen to them


Wednesday July   who own the wealth of nations take care to downplay the immensity of their holdings while emphasizing the supposedly benign features of the socio order over which they preside With its regiments of lawmakers and opinion the ruling hierarchs produce a never cavalcade of symbols images and narratives to disguise and legitimate the system of exploitative social relations existing between the  and the  Nobel Peace Prize would seem to play an incidental role in all this Given the avalanche of system class propaganda and ideological scenarios dished out to us the Nobel Peace Prize remains just a prize But a most prestigious one it is enjoying a celebrated status in its anointment of already notable personages October  in all apparent seriousness the Norwegian Nobel Committee  by the Norwegian Parliament bestowed the Nobel Peace Prize upon the European Union  Let me say that again the European Union with its  member states and  million inhabitants was awarded for having  to the advancement of peace and reconciliation democracy and human rights in Europe  itself is not a member of the EU The Norwegians had the good sense to vote against joining Nobel will  explicitly states that the peace prize should go  the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses  EU is not a person and has not worked for the abolition or reduction of standing armies or promotion of any kind of peace agenda If the EU award looked a bit awkward the BBC and other mainstream news media came to the rescue referring to the  decades of peace and  years without war that the EU supposedly has achieved  following day somebody at the BBC did the numbers and started proclaiming that the EU had brought  years of peace on the European continent  could these wise pundits possibly be thinking Originally called the European Economic Community and formed in  the European Union was established under its current name in  about twenty years ago Nobel Committee the EU recipients and the western media all overlooked the  full air war launched on the European continent against Yugoslavia a socialist democracy that for the most part had offered a good life to people of various Slavic nationalities many of them still testify today EU did not oppose that aggression In fact a number of  member states including Germany and France joined in the  war on European soil led largely by the United States For  days U and other NATO forces bombed Yugoslavian factories utilities power stations rail systems bridges hotels apartment buildings schools and hospitals killing thousands of civilians all in the name of a humanitarian rescue operation all fueled by unsubstantiated stories of Serbian  All this warfare took place on European soil was shattered along with its uniquely designed participatory democracy with its self and social ownership system In its place emerged a cluster of right mini wherein everything has been privatized and deregulated and poverty has replaced amplitude Meanwhile rich western corporations are doing quite well in what was once Yugoslavia aside EU member states have sent troops to Afghanistan Iraq Libya and additional locales in Africa the Middle East and Central Asia usually under the tutorship of the U war machine what was I to expect For years I ironically asserted that the best way to win a Nobel Peace Prize was to wage war or support those who wage war instead of peace  overstatement perhaps but take a look start back in  with an improbable Nobel winner Nicholas Murray Butler president of Columbia University During World War I Butler explicitly forbade all faculty from criticizing the Allied war against the Central Powers He equated anti sentiments with sedition and treason He also claimed that  educated proletariat is a constant source of disturbance and danger to any nation In the  Butler became an outspoken supporter of Italy fascist dictator Benito Mussolini Some years later he became an admirer of a heavily militarized Nazi Germany In  two years after receiving the Nobel prize Butler invited the German ambassador to the U to speak at Columbia in defense of Hitler He rejected student appeals to cancel the invitation claiming it would violate academic freedom ahead to  the year one of the most notorious of war criminals Henry Kissinger received the Nobel Peace Prize For the better part of a decade Kissinger served as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and as U Secretary of State presiding over the seemingly endless blood in Indochina and ruthless U interventions in Central America and elsewhere From carpet bombing to death squads Kissinger was there beating down on those who dared resist U power In his writings and pronouncements Kissinger continually talked about maintaining U military and political influence throughout the world If anyone fails to fit Alfred Nobel description of a prize winner it would be Henry Kissinger  we come to Nobel winner Andrei Sakharov a darling of the U press a Soviet dissident who regularly sang praises to corporate capitalism Sakharov lambasted the U peace movement for its opposition to the Vietnam War He accused the Soviets of being the sole culprits behind the arms race and he supported every U armed intervention abroad as a defense of democracy Hailed in the west as a  rights advocate Sakharov never had an unkind word for the horrific human rights violations perpetrated by the fascist regimes of faithful U client states including Pinochet Chile and Suharto Indonesia and he aimed snide remarks at the  who did He regularly attacked those in the West who opposed U repressive military interventions abroad us not overlook Mother Teresa All the western world media hailed that crabby lady as a self saint In fact she was a mean spirited reactionary who gladly welcomed the destruction of liberation theology and other progressive developments in the world Her  and  were little more than warehouses for the dying and for those who suffered from curable diseases that went untreated leading to death She waged campaigns against birth control divorce and abortion She readily hobnobbed with the rich and reactionary but she was so heavily hyped as a heavenly heroine that the folks in Oslo just had to give her the big medal in  there was the Dalai Lama who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in  For years the Dalai Lama was on the payroll of the CIA an agency that has perpetrated killings against rebellious workers peasants students and others in countries around the world His eldest brother played an active role in a CIA group Another brother established an intelligence operation with the CIA which included a CIA guerrilla unit whose recruits parachuted back into Tibet to foment insurgency The Dalai Lama was no pacifist He supported the U military intervention into Afghanistan also the  days bombing of Yugoslavia and the destruction of that country As for the years of carnage and destruction wrought by U forces in Iraq the Dalai Lama was undecided  too early to say right or wrong said he in  Regarding the violence that members of his sect perpetrated against a rival sect he concluded that  the goal is good then the method even if apparently of the violent kind is permissible Spoken like a true Nobel recipient  in a fit of self parody the folks in Oslo gave the Nobel Peace Prize  President Barack Obama while he produced record military budgets and presided over three or four wars and a number of other attack operations followed a couple of years later by additional wars in Yemen West Pakistan Libya and Syria  Iran pending Nobel winner Obama also proudly hunted down and murdered Osama Bin Laden having accused him a shred of evidence masterminding the  attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon could see that Obama was somewhat surprised maybe even embarrassed the award Here was this young drone commander trying to show what a tough warrior he was saluting the flag coffins one day and attacking other places and peoples the next of violence in support of the New World Order certainly every bit worthy of a Nobel peace medal are probably other Nobel war hawks and reactionaries to inspect I don pretend to be informed about every prize winner And there are a few worthy recipients who come to mind such as Martin Luther King Jr Linus Pauling Nelson Mandela and Dag Hammarskj us return to the opening point does the European Union actually qualify for the prize Vancouver artist Jennifer Brouse gave me the last  best word  Nobel Prize for the EU That seems like a rather convenient and resounding endorsement for current cutthroat austerity measures First corporations are people then money is free speech now an organization of nation states designed to thwart national sovereignty on behalf of ruling class interests receives a prize for peace On the other hand if the EU is a person then it should be prosecuted for imposing policies leading directly to the violent repression of peaceful protests and to the misery and death of its suffering citizens sum the Nobel Peace Prize often has nothing to do with peace and too much to do with war It frequently sees  through the eyes of the western plutocracy For that reason alone we should not join in the applause Parenti recent books include God and His Demons  Contrary Notions The Michael Parenti Reader  Lights Democracy for the

Bacteria communicate with one another via the production and detection of secreted signal molecules called autoinducers This cell communication process called  Sensing allows bacteria to synchronize behavior on a population scale Behaviors controlled by quorum sensing are usually ones that are unproductive when undertaken by an individual bacterium acting alone but become effective when undertaken in unison by the group For example quorum sensing controls virulence factor production biofilm formation and the excretion of public goods such as enzymes that solubilize solid food sources making them accessible for consumption We developed small molecule quorum agonists and antagonists to discover the principles underlying the exquisite selectivity quorum receptors have for their cognate ligands Our results suggest mechanisms bacteria use in the wild to ensure the proper ligand has interacted with its partner receptor prior to eliciting signal transduction We suggest that in their native environments bacteria encounter mixtures of autoinducers produced by other species occupying the same niche Precise autoinducer discrimination enables a particular species of bacteria to respond exclusively to its own signal even in the face of fierce competition This ability prevents the leakage of benefits of quorum public goods to non Beyond learning about fundamental principles underlying quorum sensing another use for our synthetic molecules is to control quorum sensing on demand Indeed our most potent quorum sensing antagonist protects animals from quorum killing by pathogenic bacteria and prevents biofilm formation in model microfluidics chambers that mimic medical devices These results validate the notion that targeting quorum sensing has potential for antimicrobial drug development      Forum Karolinska InstitutetRead more HERE

Whistle site and the Internet in general are among the  nominees for the  Nobel Peace Prize with winners to be announced in October


WikiLeaks and the Internet are among the  nominees for the  Nobel Peace Prize


The Nobel nomination comes as Julian Assange the spokesman for the secret site is facing possible extradition to Sweden on sex charges and a criminal probe on likely espionage charges is underway in the Washington D area


Nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize may come from any professor of  sciences history philosophy law and theology in addition to national governments and former Nobel Peace Prize recipients under the rules of the Norwegian Nobel Committee


Previous Nobel Peace Prize winners have included Barack Obama Jimmy Carter the United Nations and Kofi Annan Al Gore Desmond Tutu and Henry Kissinger They awarded by a committee composed of current and former Norwegian government officials


The committee doesn announce nominees but individuals who have submitted suggestions are free to disclose them


 at the long term we can say interest in the prize is strong and growing along with the number of candidates Geir Lundestad a non member of the Nobel panel told Reuters The winners will be announced in October


One reason the Internet may have been nominated is the role it played in catalyzing revolts in Libya Tunisia and Egypt Activists coordinated protests using Facebook and instant messaging services and filed dispatches with YouTube and Twitter leading to a complete disconnect in Egypt and severe disruptions in Libya

America  Independent News Source Photo Martin Norwegian Nobel Committee based in Oslo Norway announced yesterday the name of their laureate for the  Prize for Peace President Barack Hussain Obama is their selection for this years prestigious award With the Nobel Institutes selection President Obama becomes the third man ever to win a Nobel Prize more than one time He joins legendary physicist John Bardeen and brilliant chemist Fredrick Sanger who were each awarded two Nobels in their respective fields Obama first Nobel Peace Prize was awarded by the committee shortly after he took office in  Viewed as contentious at the time his selection as a laureate was described by the committee as being due to his creation in international politics of a new political climate which emphasized multilateralism and his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples Strong objections were raised at the time by many who were critical of the Nobel Committee choice of President Obama Many argued that his selection so soon after having ascended to the Presidency was a political handout from the Norwegians He had not been in a position to effect international diplomacy for any measurable time Nor had he actually accomplished any action of note that had led to the spread of international peace It seemed that he had been selected for no other reason than that he was elected to the Presidency forward to the year  the Nobel Committee has once again selected President Obama though this time he has had ample time and opportunity to make his mark upon the world stage The Nobel Committee cited three separate contributing factors which led to their choice of President Obama a second time The first was his for his leadership in brokering a diplomatic solution to the disarmament of chemical weapons in Syria The second was for his strong commitment to drawing down the military presence of The United States in foreign countries most notably Afghanistan and Iraq The third was for his strong and continuing support of the United Nations and international law Specifically his commitment to the U Assembly to move aggressively forward on U resolution  and provide support for UNODA peace prize will be awarded to President Obama on October the tenth of this year at the Nobel Institute Oslo headquarters President Obama has expressed his gratitude to the Nobel Committee for their consideration of him as a laureate He has subsequently pledged to donate the cash portion of the annual Nobel Prize to several charities that serve the domestic United States Obama consistently stands for our nation finest principles  CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES   the People of the United States in Order to form a more perfect Union establish Justice insure domestic Tranquility provide for the common defence promote the general Welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America  He steadily abides by and speaks for our world pride which is our nation integrity  and yes  our President has not kept him from behaving with dignity and pride   Congratulations Mr President Well done  by Kathryn on July   at  pm are delusionalWhat your problem Bill  Too many facts you have some that would be great  If there were a Nobel prize for Chaos I would be behind him   The world is in Chaos race relations are at their worst in  years  What PEACE has this man brought to anyone Roy it morons like you that hate this man because he is a black man is the reasons that race relations are as bad as they always were The only thing that has changed is that when they elected this President not once but twice overwhelmingly all you racist

lovers like you Without having met or spent  minutes with the person you call  that you call out and condemn as racists simply because someone has the nerve to question one of the president policies or position on any matter Regardless of who the president is or what party they belong to I can remember a single one who I ever agreed with on every single issue every single time  of the time None But for the truly dedicated morons that like you who worships at  ass crack it easy for you to turn someone into a Klan member and racist hater simply for questioning your Supreme Leader position on anything no matter how minute And that makes you ignorant on the issues and exposes you as tool who blindly follow the president because he told you to FYI being a real racist requires more than just simply disagreeing with  on his policies  He is beyond delusional are correct Pat Tovey And btw he was awarded the first Nobel prize because he spent a big part of his first nine months in office meeting with other world leaders to mend the damage done by his predecessor  In my opinion he earned that prize as well Martin Are we talking the same Obama who is the largest gun dealer in the world do you know of any other President Obama  Duh From reading your replies it seems you have some real issues with President Obama I guess hes done next to nothing to make your life better safer


anything What about those gas prices Just asking Lorenzo understand your question  about those gas prices Just asking Was either intended as humor or as a slight to me However since I been paying between  to  per gallon for a number of years now therefore I fail to see the point Has something unexpected happened with the gas prices was awarded first Nobel Prize for being elected up timelineI wonder how many innocent people abroad have died under his  plan Still I always amazed that people as dumb as you still exist You need to thank God or the universe for making breathing an involuntary reflex For if it required any thinking at all you wouldn be here to type that BS Obama does indeed deserve the Nobel Peace Prize  for giving our country away  He does not stand by our nation constitution Examples include


 Expansion of the employer mandate penalty through IRS regulation


 Assault on free speech and due process on college campuses Pat Tovey  low information recipient opposed to Having young Americans die in Iraq in a war Bush concocted to reward war economy Orchestrating a financial collapse so money from American tax payers would be dispersed to Bush and Cheney supportersThank  absolutely true  Anyone who thinks this is delusional is deceived by Satan couldn have said it better myself agree with everything Pat Tovey has to say  Not Pat Roy  Had to clarify this huh Well I guess since Obama has been called Satan and I definitely drinking his kool The ironic thing to me is that this post agrees with a post that states that Obama is acting unconstitutionally when the cited examples are all constitutional exercises of executive power Perhaps someones of you might learn a thing or two by ACTUALLY READING the constitution You can google it It out there are absolutely  correct couldn have said it better myself of these negative comments are the reason why Barack Obama should have done more with mental health care and maybe he would have gotten a Nobel prize for that too  Fake story genius  he deserves to be executed not rewardedObama has been the most toxic person to American in history  All this proves is radical liberals reward each other a jokeHe has done it again  Through all the smear campaigns all the hate and comes out smelling like a rose Pauling  behind large dose C therapy is not mentioned He won two Nobel Prizes as well Pauling won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry   Nobel Peace Prize  They are not the same John Bardeen Fredrick Sanger  Barack Obama are still the only  who have the Nobel Peace Prize twice consistently tries to bypass the Constitution ya kiddin are worse than ever in the Middle East and meddling in Arab politics led to it fools Pauling received nobels for chemistry and peace almost go a second or chemistry when he nearly beat out Watson and Crick discovery of the double helix Obama  Harvard Law Editor of Law Review Professor of Constitutional Law at university of Chicago  obviously haven read the Constitution and it supporting documents and have no idea what it really says said Because to get out of even mediocre law school requires a thorough knowledge of the Constitution and the Founders aims along with the relevant law that accumulated since  You might look into reality are so right Missbike published at Harvard did he get that position

Tu Youyou a pharmacologist with the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing working on artemisinin a drug therapy for malaria in the  Yang Wumin the height of the Cultural Revolution Project   a covert operation launched by the Chinese government and headed by a young Chinese medical researcher by the name of Tu Youyou  discovered what has been the most powerful and effective antimalarial drug therapy to date  Known in Chinese as qinghaosu and derived from the sweet wormwood  annua L artemisinin was only one of several hundred substances Tu and her team of researchers culled from Chinese drugs and folk remedies and systematically tested in their search for a treatment to chloroquine malaria How Tu and her team discovered artemisinin tells us much about the continual Chinese effort to negotiate between traditional and indigenous Indeed contrary to popular assumptions that Maoist China was summarily against science and scientists the Communist party needed the scientific elite for certain political and practical purposes Medicine particularly when it also involved foreign relations was one such area In this case it was the war in Vietnam and the scourge of malaria that led to the organization of Project  A Request From Vietnam and a Military Answer As fighting escalated between American and Vietnamese forces throughout the  malaria became the number one affliction compromising Vietnamese soldier health The increasing number of chloroquine malaria cases in the civilian population further heightened North Vietnamese concern In  the North Vietnamese government approached Chinese leader Mao Tse Tung and asked for Chinese assistance in combating malaria Mao responded  your problem is the same as solving our own From the beginning Project  which was classified as a top state mission was under the direction of military authorities Although civilian agencies were invited to collaborate in May  military supervision highlighted the urgent nature of the research and protected it from adverse political winds The original three plan produced by the People Liberation Army Research Institute aimed to  far and near integrate Chinese and Western medicines take Chinese drugs as its priority emphasize innovation unify plans divide labor to work together Medical Mission Project  had three goals the identification of new drug treatments for fighting chloroquine malaria the development of long preventative measures against chloroquine malaria and the development of mosquito repellents To achieve these ends research on Chinese drugs and acupuncture was integral The decision to investigate Chinese drugs was not without precedent Back in  Chen Kehui and Carl Schmidt of the Peking Union Medical College published their original paper on ephedrine derived from Chinese herb mahuang It ignited a research fire in which more than  scientific papers on ephedrine  relief for asthma appeared around the world by  In the  state interest in the Chinese drug changshan and its antimalarial properties led to the establishment of a state research institute and experimental farm in Sichuan province Project  embrace of Chinese materia medica  the traditional body of knowledge about substances healing properties  is a more recent example of the efforts to  Chinese medicine through selective appropriation and detailed investigation Biomedical interest in Chinese drugs was not in itself new But the institutional climate within which Project  investigators worked was different from earlier antimalarial research efforts The Vietnam War had exacerbated an epidemiological crisis to which Maoist China responded with nationalist fervor by turning to its institutions of traditional Chinese medicine In the  such institutions were a mixing ground of specialists many of whom possessed more than a passing familiarity with Chinese medicine and biomedicine This ensured that qinghao research proceeded within a climate in which scientists  themselves had learnt the ways of appreciating traditional knowledge worked side by side with historians of traditional medicine who had textual learning Youyou Story Tu Youyou research fits within this Maoist story of medical systematization and standardization Born in  she was a medical student during the  when state efforts to make Chinese medicine scientific through the research and expertise of biomedical researchers were especially acute She rose to the head of a malaria research group at the Beijing Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in  The group was composed of phytochemical researchers who studied the chemical compounds that occur naturally in plants and pharmacological researchers who focused on the science of drugs They began with a list of over  Chinese herbal preparations of which  preparations were found to have possible antimalarial activities They worked steadily and obtained more than  extracts from some  Chinese herbs which they then evaluated against a mouse model of malaria Of the  extracts they had obtained a qinghao  annua L extract appeared promising but inconsistently so Faced with varying results Tu and her team returned to the existing materia medica literature and reexamined each instance in which qinghao appeared in a traditional recipe Tu was drawn to one particular reference made by Ge Hong   in his fourth BC text Emergency Prescriptions One Keeps Up One Sleeve Ge Hong instructed take a bunch of qing hao and two sheng  x  liter of water for soaking it wring it out to obtain the juice and ingest it in its entirety In what can be characterized as her eureka moment Tu had the idea that  heating involved in the conventional extraction step we had used might have destroyed the active components and that extraction at a lower temperature might be necessary to preserve antimalarial activity Her hunch proved correct once they switched to a lower procedure Tu and her team obtained much better and more consistent antimalarial activity with qinghao By  they had obtained a nontoxic and neutral extract that was called qinghaosu or artemisinin It was  effective against malarial parasites in animal models Tu research has drawn accolades from the international scientific community while also igniting a debate in the Chinese language media about the celebration of individual inventors over collective group efforts This too perhaps may be part of the legacy of Maoist mass science which demanded research that served practical needs and engaged the masses Scientific achievement while important was not the be end of scientific work During the Cultural Revolution it mattered that science proceed along revolutionary lines It mattered that scientific advances resulted from collective endeavor and drew from popular sources Does it still This story was written for The Conversation by Jia Fu assistant professor of Chinese at Emory University It is republished here with permission

Elie Wiesel the Holocaust survivor who served as a voice for millions and prominently drove attention toward that and other mass atrocities in the  century died Saturday at the age of  Wiesel was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize in  the time the Nobel committee said he had  as one of the most important spiritual leaders and guides in an age when violence repression and racism continue to characterize the world is the speech Wiesel gave while accepting the prize in Oslo on Dec   is with a profound sense of humility that I accept the honor you have chosen to bestow upon me I know your choice transcends me This both frightens and pleases me frightens me because I wonder do I have the right to represent the multitudes who have perished Do I have the right to accept this great honor on their behalf  I do not That would be presumptuous No one may speak for the dead no one may interpret their mutilated dreams and visions pleases me because I may say that this honor belongs to all the survivors and their children and through us to the Jewish people with whose destiny I have always identified remember it happened yesterday or eternities ago A young Jewish boy discovered the kingdom of night I remember his bewilderment I remember his anguish It all happened so fast The ghetto The deportation The sealed cattle car The fiery altar upon which the history of our people and the future of mankind were meant to be sacrificed remember he asked his father  this be true This is the twentieth century not the Middle Ages Who would allow such crimes to be committed How could the world remain silent now the boy is turning to me  me he asks  have you done with my future What have you done with your life I tell him that I have tried That I have tried to keep memory alive that I have tried to fight those who would forget Because if we forget we are guilty we are accomplices then I explained to him how naive we were that the world did know and remain silent And that is why I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation We must always take sides Neutrality helps the oppressor never the victim Silence encourages the tormentor never the tormented Sometimes we must interfere When human lives are endangered when human dignity is in jeopardy national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant Wherever men or women are persecuted because of their race religion or political views that place must  at that moment  become the center of the universe course since I am a Jew profoundly rooted in my peoples memory and tradition my first response is to Jewish fears Jewish needs Jewish crises For I belong to a traumatized generation one that experienced the abandonment and solitude of our people It would be unnatural for me not to make Jewish priorities my own Israel Soviet Jewry Jews in Arab lands  But there are others as important to me Apartheid is in my view as abhorrent as anti To me Andrei Sakharov isolation is as much of a disgrace as Josef Biegun imprisonment As is the denial of Solidarity and its leader Lech Walesa right to dissent And Nelson Mandela interminable imprisonment is so much injustice and suffering crying out for our attention victims of hunger of racism and political persecution writers and poets prisoners in so many lands governed by the Left and by the Right Human rights are being violated on every continent More people are oppressed than free And then too there are the Palestinians to whose plight I am sensitive but whose methods I deplore Violence and terrorism are not the answer Something must be done about their suffering and soon I trust Israel for I have faith in the Jewish people Let Israel be given a chance let hatred and danger be removed from her horizons and there will be peace in and around the Holy Land I have faith Faith in God and even in His creation Without it no action would be possible And action is the only remedy to indifference the most insidious danger of all Isn this the meaning of Alfred Nobel legacy Wasn his fear of war a shield against war is much to be done there is much that can be done One person  a Raoul Wallenberg an Albert Schweitzer one person of integrity can make a difference a difference of life and death As long as one dissident is in prison our freedom will not be true As long as one child is hungry our lives will be filled with anguish and shame What all these victims need above all is to know that they are not alone that we are not forgetting them that when their voices are stifled we shall lend them ours that while their freedom depends on ours the quality of our freedom depends on theirs is what I say to the young Jewish boy wondering what I have done with his years It is in his name that I speak to you and that I express to you my deepest gratitude No one is as capable of gratitude as one who has emerged from the kingdom of night We know that every moment is a moment of grace every hour an offering not to share them would mean to betray them Our lives no longer belong to us alone they belong to all those who need us desperately you Chairman Aarvik Thank you members of the Nobel Committee Thank you people of Norway for declaring on this singular occasion that our survival has meaning for mankind browser is out of date Please update your browser at http


Two members of the Norwegian parliament say NSA whistle Edward Snowden has made  critical contribution to restoring the balance between national security and civil liberties whistle Edward Snowden has been nominated for the  Nobel Peace Prize


Two members of Norway parliament put forward the nomination saying Snowden has made  critical contribution to restoring the balance between  country legitimate need for reliable intelligence to preserve its own security and  individual freedoms


 is no doubt that the actions of Edward Snowden may have damaged the security interests of several nations in the short term the Norwegians  Socialist Left party members B Vegar Solhjell and Snorre Valen  said in remarks sent to the Nobel Committee  do not necessarily condone or support all of his disclosures We are however convinced that the public debate and changes in policy that have followed in the wake of Snowden whistle have contributed to a more stable and peaceful world order


Snowden name will join those of numerous others who be nominated for the prize Many people around the world  any government officials members of international courts or national assemblies professors and previous Nobel winners among them  can offer up candidates for the award Last year a record  nominations were received by the committee with  for individuals and  for organizations The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was named the winner Nominees names are usually kept secret for  years but as in this case they sometimes revealed by the nominators


Snowden home country is engaged in a debate over whether the former NSA contractor  now in Russia under temporary asylum and wanted by the US government under the Espionage Act  should be considered a hero or a traitor


President Obama recently told The New Yorker magazine that  benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done  national security because there was another way of doing it


But Snowden maintains that leaking secret documents to journalists was the only way he had to make the NSA spy programs known 


In a live Web chat last week he attacked current whistle laws  are so many holes in the laws the protections they afford are so weak and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing


The Washington Post Switch blog noted that it would be ironic if Snowden managed to nab the Peace Prize just a few years after Obama  win


A Swedish professor put forward Snowden name for last year prize not long after the first reports based on the leaks appeared But the deadline for nominations was already past  year cut is February  with the winner announced October 


At the time the UK Daily Mail newspaper reported that the professor  Stefan Svallfors who teaches sociology at Ume University  said a win for Snowden would help the Peace Prize regain credibility after what some saw as its premature awarding to Obama


 would show  committee willingness to stand up in defense of civil liberties and human rights even when such a defense  be viewed with disfavor by the world dominant military power the Daily Mail quoted Svallfors as saying


This year is also the  anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Martin Luther King It was revealed in September that the NSA spied on King And Obama referenced the civil rights leader in his recent NSA reform speech 


Snowden was slotted in at No  on Foreign Policy magazine list of the  Global Thinkers of  But he came in second to the pope for Time magazine Person of the Year award an outcome that subjected the publication to some ridicule


The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to  person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses


Here are the complete remarks sent by Solhjell and Valen to the Nobel Committee today as published by Norwegian blog Manifest Tidsskrift


We hereby nominate Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize


As former Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Corigan said  is more than simply the absence of war it is the active creation of something better Our leaders are not merely actors on a global stage of preserving self they are also political leaders whom we need to trust and hold accountable Their responsibilities go beyond realpolitik and zero games their actions have real consequences for real people


The new information technologies of the past few decades bring new possibilities for democratization transparency and freedom of expression But they also introduce new tools of oppression surveillance and espionage Massive surveillance of ordinary people communication and targeted surveillance against allied leaders is now possible on a scale that we wouldn be able to imagine two or three decades ago When democratic countries make widespread use of these possibilities without regard to people rights to free expression and the basic principles of the rule of law they undermine their own legitimacy and ability to effectively criticize and change the oppressive politics massive surveillance not to mention the censorship of authoritarian regimes


A peaceful world order depends on trust between nations and trust between people Peace brokering would be impossible without a basic level of trust International agreements on nonproliferation and disarmament would be impossible without a basic level of trust And peaceful resolutions to emerging security threats would be impossible without a basic level of trust


Edward Snowden has revealed the nature and technological prowess of modern surveillance The level of sophistication and depth of surveillance that citizens all over the world are subject to has stunned us and stirred debate all over the world By doing this he has contributed critical knowledge about how modern surveillance and intelligence directed towards states and citizens is carried out


There is no doubt that the actions of Edward Snowden may have damaged the security interests of several nations in the short term We do not necessarily condone or support all of his disclosures We are however convinced that the public debate and changes in policy that have followed in the wake of Snowden whistle have contributed to a more stable and peaceful world order His actions have in effect led to the reintroduction of trust and transparency as a leading principle in global security policies Its value can be overestimated


A country legitimate need for reliable intelligence to preserve its own security must always be balanced against the people individual freedoms  and the global need for trust  as an integral condition for stability and peace Edward Snowden has made a critical contribution to restoring this balance

Roger Myerson wins  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics


Roger B Myerson a University of Chicago economist and an expert on game theory was named Monday one of three winners of the  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences


He was recognized for his contributions to mechanism design theory initiated by co Leonid Hurwicz of the University of Minnesota and which Myerson further developed with others including co Eric Maskin of the Institute for Advanced Study another recipient of the  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics Hurwicz was a researcher with the Cowles Commission from  to  when it was 


The theory allows for people to distinguish situations in which markets work well from those in which they do not It has helped economists identify efficient trading mechanisms regulation schemes and voting procedures Today mechanism design theory plays a central role in many areas of economics and parts of political science


  theory of mechanism design seeks to understand how resources can be allocated in socially effective ways even when the information needed to perform the task is spread among many individuals


  effective mechanism provides those individuals with incentives to reveal their information truthfully so that the desired allocation can be implemented Roger Myerson made a path 


contribution to the theory of mechanism design when he discovered a fundamental connection between 


the allocation to be implemented and the monetary transfers needed to induce informed agents to reveal their information truthfully


  fundamental theorem now called the revenue equivalence theorem forms a crucial part


 of a vast literature on mechanism design and is used especially heavily in the design of auctions It is now impossible to work in the field of mechanism design without a thorough understanding of Myerson result 


Myerson is the Glen A Lloyd Distinguished Service Professor in Economics and the College and Myerson has made seminal contributions to the fields of economics and political science In game theory he introduced a refinement of Nash equilibrium concept called  equilibrium He has applied game theoretic tools to political science to study and compare electoral systems and he also developed fundamental ideas of mechanism design such as the revelation principle and  theorem


Myerson also has developed computer software for auditing formulas and for simulation and decision analysis for use with Microsoft spreadsheet software


He is the author of Game Theory Analysis of Conflict  and Probability Models for Economic Decisions  Myerson also has published numerous articles in Econometrica Mathematics of Operations Research and the International Journal of Game Theory for which he served as an editorial board member for  years


During his  tenure at Northwestern University Myerson twice served as a Visiting Professor in Economics at Chicago He joined the Chicago faculty in 


He received his A summa cum laude and S in applied mathematics in  from Harvard University and a Ph also in applied mathematics from Harvard University in  ImagesClick images to download high versions All images by Lloyd DeGrane on Monday Oct  middle image Nobel Prize winners  left James Heckman Roger Myerson Gary Becker and Robert Lucas  current University faculty members lower right image The winner son  Myerson and wife  Myerson Information announcement from NobelPrize from NobelPrize for the public The Prize in Economic Sciences   on Mechanism Design Theory  work by Prof Myerson  of the State in Theory and Practice Reading Bremer and the Counterinsurgency Field Manual

Nitric oxide was named  of the Year in  by the journal Science but it took another  years for those responsible for the major discoveries surrounding it to win the Nobel Prize Three US scientists F Furchgott PhD Louis J Ignarro PhD and Ferid Murad MD PhD receive the  Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine on December   in Stockholm Sweden discovery of nitric oxide signaling role in the cardiovascular and nervous systems is now nearly  years old but its clinical use is only beginning Dr Furchgott a distinguished professor of pharmacology at the State University of New York  at Brooklyn began the studies that led to the identification of nitric oxide as a biological agent in  At that time he was trying to reconcile the contradictory effects drugs had on blood vessels He concluded that endothelial cells produce an unknown signal molecule that makes vascular smooth muscle cells relax He called the signal molecule EDRF or endothelium relaxing factor unrelated experiments Dr Murad now chairman of the integrative biology department at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston was analyzing how nitroglycerin works In  while at the University of Virginia he found that nitrates release nitric oxide which relaxes smooth muscle cells resulting in vasodilation He was fascinated that the colorless odorless gas could act as a signaling molecule Ignarro now a professor of pharmacology at UCLA School of Medicine in Los Angeles California through a series of analyses concluded in  that EDRF was identical to nitric oxide His work done independently and together with that of Dr Furchgott prompted an increase in research activities in many areas of the world Nobel committee could recognize only  scientists and their decision not to name Salvador Moncada PhD a professor at University College London as one of the awardees provoked some comment The controversy was similar to that when the Albert Lasker Awards were announced in  At that time Drs Murad and Furchgott were the awardees and omission of Drs Ignarro and Moncada aroused comment However Dr Moncada has made no protest Michael E DeBakey MD chairman emeritus of the Lasker Award jury said Murad and Furchgott received that prize because the work represents  fundamental finding affecting the circulation It is a fundamental and important observation Furchgott  said he was mildly surprised to have won the Nobel prize because most such prizes go to more popular areas such as molecular research He described himself as an old pharmacologist Murad  who had held his University of Texas position only  months when the prize was announced said he had been called by the secretary of the Nobel committee at  am Central Standard Time He rushed upstairs to shower and don a coat and tie before photographers appeared at the door fantastic to recognized by one peers he said  like to share this with so many of the trainees who have worked with me over the years the Nobel prize recognized was the scientists dogged efforts to prove that nitric oxide an endogenous gas and also a free radical could have this kind of crucial biological effect Research has proven the crucial role the gas plays in such fundamental biological processes as regulation of blood pressure functioning and malfunctioning of the immune system and activation of mechanisms in the central nervous system affecting everything from gastric motility to memory to behavior known only as an air pollutant nitric oxide and its related enzymes could one day provide the basis for the development of drugs that could treat everything from Alzheimer disease to high blood pressure Its inhibition could play a role in treatment of sepsis and dangerous hypotension and the ability to increase its activity might lead to a treatment for hypertension of the recipients of this year Nobel prize has a distinguished career in research Dr Furchgott born June   in Charleston SC received his BS from the University of North Carolina and his PhD in biochemistry at Northwestern University in Chicago Ill He began his career at SUNY in  and has continued there ever since He holds honorary doctorates at several universities and is the recipient of numerous awards other than the Lasker and the Nobel Murad born September   in Whiting Ind received his undergraduate degree from DePauw University in Greencastle Ind His MD and PhD in pharmacology were received from Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland Ohio He did his residency at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston He served as professor and director of clinical research at the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville and was director of the division of clinical pharmacology there from  to  Virginia Dr Murad went to Stanford University in California in  where he was a professor of internal medicine and pharmacology until  He served as chief of medicine at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Medical Center from  until  In  he became vice president for pharmaceutical research and development at Abbott Laboratories in Illinois and served as an adjunct professor in the department of pharmacology at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago In  he started his own biotech firm called Molecular Geriatrics Corporation in Lake Bluff Ill but he left the post of president there to return to academia at the University of Texas at Houston in  Ignarro was born May   in Brooklyn NY He obtained his BA in pharmacy at Columbia University in New York NY and his PhD in pharmacology at the University of Minnesota From  to  he was a professor in the department of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans La In  he joined the faculty of the department of pharmacology at UCLA where he is currently a professor Dr Ignarro was out of the country when the Nobel award was announced

Three researchers helped revolutionize lighting with vastly better energy efficiency and brightness The light diodes also are used in data storage TVs and smartphones by Higgs bosons quantum mechanics and the accelerating  expansion of the universe This year physics Nobel Prize is for  something that reassuringly understandable and useful the blue LEDs  used in everything from home lighting and headlights to TV screens and  traffic signals researchers received the  Nobel Prize in physics  on Tuesday for the invention of this blue light diode  a  technology now used in high networking data storage smartphones  water purification and efficient home illumination The winners are Isamu Akasaki a Japanese citizen and professor at Meijo University and Nagoya University Hiroshi Amano a Japanese citizen and professor at Nagoya University and Shuji Nakamura an American citizen and professor at the University of California in Santa Barbara The key advantage of their invention  years ago is the production of light with far less waste of electrical energy than with preceding technologies like incandescent and fluorescent lights the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in awarding the prize quarter of energy consumption goes to illumination said Per Delsing a physics professor at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden during a press conference announcing the award As a result any increase in efficiency and consequent saving of energy  really going to have a big impact on modern civilization he said Prizes in physics often go to fundamental discoveries such as the Higgs Boson But when the committee makes an award for an invention  really emphasize the usefulness of the invention said Anne L an atomic physics professor at Lund University in Sweden also speaking at the press conference And the blue LED is nothing if not useful Nobel prizes have been awarded for concepts that are very far from day human experiences  giant magnetoresistance Bose condensates superconductors and superfluids and the accelerating expansion of the universe for example The blue LED  something you can buy at the local home store  seems downright mundane by comparison it anything but ordinary said H Frederick Dylla chief executive officer of the American Institute of Physics who called the work a  de force because it required a combination of materials science physics and chemistry Indeed the invention of the blue LED was on a short list of his institute candidates for the prize he said a very expensive technology requiring atomic epitaxy where layers are put down atomic layer by atomic layer at a very high vacuum Dylla said It vastly more complicated than incandescent lights he added  that to drawing tungsten wire and putting it into a blob of glass and blowing out the air with some argon and you have a light bulb for a few cents white light from the sun can be reproduced artificially by blending three colors of light red green and blue LEDs are very efficient at converting electrical energy into visible light but blue LEDs proved much harder to engineer than red and green ones It took more than a quarter century after red LEDs were invented in the early  before semiconductor materials and fabrication techniques grew sophisticated enough to enable blue LEDs in the mid LEDs work either by packaging trios of red green and blue LEDs or by using just blue LEDs whose light also excites phosphors that emit green and red those white LEDs are spreading rapidly across the globe led by lighting applications lights  the traditional Thomas Edison light bulb  work by heating up a filament until it glows That approach produces light but most of the energy is wasted as heat bulbs are more than four times more efficient a big step forward But LEDs are nearly twenty times as efficient as incandescent bulbs and they aren saddled with the risky mercury health risks of fluorescent bulbs As an added bonus LED lights last longer too LEDs are now used widely in streetlights traffic lights flashlights vehicle headlights and as costs come down home and office lights They also a major force in electronics providing the light in screens in laptops phones tablets and TVs and Amano worked together on the technology at Nagoya University while Nakamura at the time was working at Nichia Chemical Corporation It took more than a decade of work to produce practical blue designs in the  trio will split an award of about  million That a lot more than the  that Nichia paid Nakamura for his invention  but less than the  million he won in  in a lawsuit arguing that he deserved a bigger share of the royalties his invention brought in is happy to see a Nobel Prize awarded to something  comprehensible to the public But that doesn mean scientific inquiry  should be directed only toward products that have an obvious commercial  or practical benefit he said am troubled by  some who say if the government funds research it should only  be towards things that have a practical application Dylla  said  trouble with that limited view is that most of what ended up  as practical applications of science have come from rather unfettered  basic research on the nature of matter or how energy interacts with  matter example Einstein famously mind theory of general relativity may seem remote But ignoring it would make navigation with today GPS satellites  inaccurate  can trace many advances in science and engineering that have obvious  and immediate practical applications to a foundation of basic science he said at  am PTwith comment

Announced this morning in Stockholm the three geneticists Blackburn a professor of biology and physiology at the University of California San Francisco Carol Greider a professor in the department of molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore and Jack Szostak a professor of genetics at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who are all previous Scientific American authors split the award of  million Swedish kronor   million along with the prestige and honor


The work for which they received the award illuminated key aspects of the DNA replication process As genetic material is copied from the chromosome during cell division the whole DNA strand must be duplicated from end to end otherwise portions of genetic information will be lost Until the  it was a mystery as to how the chromosomes could be reliably copied the whole way through without missing bits and pieces at the very end of each strand Work completed by this year laureates demonstrated how if parts of the end telomeres were missing DNA would eventually be shortened and cut off in the replication process 


Blackburn and Szostak who had been studying the ends of chromosomes and minichromosomes respectively met at a conference in  after which they began collaborating Two years later they demonstrated in a paper published in Cell that the telomere sequence could be isolated inserted into another organism and still serve the same function Working with Blackburn Greider helped in  to identify the RNA telomerase enzyme that creates the crucial telomeres a paper published in Nature  American is part of the Nature Publishing Group 


The findings have since been applied in studies of aging stem cells and cancer Early research by Blackburn and Szostak showed that if telomeres were shortened it would lead to slower cell division and premature aging in yeast later in human cells Since the early discoveries defective telomeres have also been found to play a role in some forms of inherited anemia as they affect the division of bone marrow stem cells Cancer may also be in part a disease of telomere dysfunction Given the rapid rate of division among cancer cells they have been a more recent target of telomere research Treatments taking advantage of this new knowledge are in clinical trails data from which are still outstanding the Nobel Committee 


Although findings related to this research have been generating much excitement in the field of cancer research well as that of aging issuing the award note that much study remains to be done  it will be very important to figure out what is real what is mechanism and what is statistical noise said Goran Hansson a professor of cardiology at the Karolinska Institute and member of the Prize Committee said during the announcement press briefing 


For the researchers much of the early discoveries were driven by general curiosity about the workings of chromosomes and DNA replication  had no idea when we started this work that telomerase would be involved in cancer but were simply curious about how chromosomes stayed intact Greider said in a statement after winning the Lasker Award in  for some of the same research  approach shows that while you can do research that tries to answer specific questions about a disease you can also just follow your nose


Jeremy Berg director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences was pleased to see an example of general research chosen for the prize He calls it  great example of a curiosity process The selection of telomeres research was not a surprise to many in the field he says as the research has  moving along steadily under its own power everybody had known how important it was  there are some large questions that remain to be answered about the workings of telomeres and the associated telomerase addition to results from the ongoing clinical trials From an evolutionary standpoint for example the similarities between telomerase and the reverse transcriptase in retroviruses and living telomereless knockout mice beg for further study Berg notes

His car prices are insane if the Fed actually DID print its brains out during the Great Depression And what if it ALSO created a stock market bubble Like the Alternative Media Warned More than  Years Ago  in  just months after his swearing in president Barack Obama was crowned with an unexpected glory he won the Nobel Peace Prize for  due to  extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples Back then there was little indication that just a few years after his crowning achievement of  the war in and returning US troops from Iraq he would send US troops right back in Iraq for the  US invasion of the country in three decades but also send out US troops across the globe and launch the second cold war pushing the world to the brink of another  scale war Those who wish to read Obama teleprompted and ghostwritten acceptance  can do so here the time the White House and the fawning media was delighted by this crowning if premature achievement of the progressive president Which is why don expect much coverage of the inevitable aftermath earlier today in what France dubbed an  an unprecedented move the controversial head of Norway Nobel Peace Prize committee was removed Tuesday and demoted to the rank of mere member Thorbjoern Jagland a former Norwegian premier drew criticism after becoming committee chairman in  for awarding the prestigious Nobel to newly elected US President Barack Obama He will be replaced by current Deputy Chair Kaci Kullmann Five from AP Nobel Peace Prize awarding Norwegian Nobel Committee on Tuesday elected a new chairman to replace Thorbjoern Jagland whose six tenure has been lined with controversies  will remain a member of the voting panel but was a contentious leader attracting criticism for his dual role as committee chairman and head of the European Council when the prize was awarded to the European Union in  His leadership also was clouded by the decision to give the prize to Barack Obama in  after he had just been elected president and the  prize to the jailed dissident Liu Xiabo drew fury from China  former labor politician was replaced by the panel deputy chairman Kaci Kullmann Five a former conservative party leader She denied that Jagland ousting had anything to do with pressure from China which froze diplomatic ties to Norway after the  award did not deny that his ousting had anything to do with Obama who has since the aware become a neo warhawk who has put some of the most bloodthirsty republicans to shame and whose actions  lack thereof have led to not only global conflict intensity spiking To a  high but have generated untold riches to the shareholders of the military industrial complex Better late than neverBetter if the award had never been made turns everything to shit am wondering if this is a signal for Obama because he did not bow to his Jewish master speaking to Congress today the next time your price is gone the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee really wants to correct the wrong and fix their tarnished image they should have the balls to strip Obozo of the prize Change the records officially and take it away from him they Euroweenies Wussies would they want to set a precedent of correcting a wrong committed by TPTB  I doubt this dude cares He already got paid 


 Crap canned him just before he could get the Nobel secured for  Bakr al rescind his award to sign in just so I could say took six years for people to start understanding Obama is a liar and a fraud  is the Manchurian Candidate  he fucks over his friends twice as bad as his enemies exactly the kind of person who gets a lot of people killed while espousing the best of intentions  the word is for an anti that him  with many others strip him of the prize  is well overdue for some public shaming  that he care but we will Hitler was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in  but he didn win it don buy this love smoke sh one bit think the honeymoon is over after  years with net shreiking in CONgress with no WH invitation and now early AW chair i would schmuck committee chairman denigrated the entire

there was It is common for nobel prizes to be awarded posthumously  often after the recipient faced professional ruin and penury for their contribution but I have never heard of a nobel prize being given for something that someone hoped that they would do it was a break with traditionsbut seriously it was also a political message a very simple one directed obliquely at Mr Bush and Mr Cheney doubt this dude cares He already got paid he resides in a french castle with seven butlers warhawk who has put some of the most bloodthirsty republicans to shame I get it There is no difference between the parties but this Tyler hates Republicans with a purple passion but but is a neoLIBERAL fucking difference if you ask meI think that TD obvious point but I get it now Kaiserhof is on a mission you continue to read you will understand that the only part of the deep state the  Tylers really hate is the military to square that with freedom tolerance and pursuit of happiness kinda like Russia military though  but I think she just has a thang for midgets be man boobs on horseback dear gawd I offended a Russian national voting  why wouldn the Tylers blast both parties the MIC CIA and Mossad The Russians haven done a thing that I can see that warranrts harsh criticism compared to all those assholes who are pushing the world towards nuclear war I have no fucking idea what you guys are talking about sometimes of going monarchism to   just love that warm  fuzzy term for state control of everything and butchering of anyone who didn  an oligarchy don even know how that works at least capitalists say they are about making a profit outright with no BS or they stay home they don hoodwink farmers  laborers into working harder for  Russia or oligarchs or the state they do it for themselves their families self interest self interest is not greed just love that warm  fuzzy term for control of everything wil not have peace in the world until a new system of ownership takes hold and replace Capitalism and this is Co must become Co Russians haven done a thing that I can see that warrants harsh criticism compared to all those assholes who are pushing the world towards nuclear war view or better non Russia could have played a different game against those assholes But then it would now not be in the possession of Crimeathe very search of moral high ground in this conflict smacks me of a deeply ingrained habit of partisanship black vs white hats good versus evilwell let hope peace returns despite the warmongers on both sidesWhy don you point out where the Americans  we are Americans reading an American blog about things American in America for the most part where their criticism of anything USA is incorrect I know about the Tylers is that they must have hired some young eager to impress archivist are going to the archives within a week all of a sudden like neo progressive Nothing liberal about him He doesn give s shit about your rights It all abour power and

Two members of the Norwegian parliament say NSA whistle Edward Snowden has made  critical contribution to restoring the balance between national security and civil liberties whistle Edward Snowden has been nominated for the  Nobel Peace Prize


Two members of Norway parliament put forward the nomination saying Snowden has made  critical contribution to restoring the balance between  country legitimate need for reliable intelligence to preserve its own security and  individual freedoms


 is no doubt that the actions of Edward Snowden may have damaged the security interests of several nations in the short term the Norwegians  Socialist Left party members B Vegar Solhjell and Snorre Valen  said in remarks sent to the Nobel Committee  do not necessarily condone or support all of his disclosures We are however convinced that the public debate and changes in policy that have followed in the wake of Snowden whistle have contributed to a more stable and peaceful world order


Snowden name will join those of numerous others who be nominated for the prize Many people around the world  any government officials members of international courts or national assemblies professors and previous Nobel winners among them  can offer up candidates for the award Last year a record  nominations were received by the committee with  for individuals and  for organizations The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was named the winner Nominees names are usually kept secret for  years but as in this case they sometimes revealed by the nominators


Snowden home country is engaged in a debate over whether the former NSA contractor  now in Russia under temporary asylum and wanted by the US government under the Espionage Act  should be considered a hero or a traitor


President Obama recently told The New Yorker magazine that  benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done  national security because there was another way of doing it


But Snowden maintains that leaking secret documents to journalists was the only way he had to make the NSA spy programs known 


In a live Web chat last week he attacked current whistle laws  are so many holes in the laws the protections they afford are so weak and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing


The Washington Post Switch blog noted that it would be ironic if Snowden managed to nab the Peace Prize just a few years after Obama  win


A Swedish professor put forward Snowden name for last year prize not long after the first reports based on the leaks appeared But the deadline for nominations was already past  year cut is February  with the winner announced October 


At the time the UK Daily Mail newspaper reported that the professor  Stefan Svallfors who teaches sociology at Ume University  said a win for Snowden would help the Peace Prize regain credibility after what some saw as its premature awarding to Obama


 would show  committee willingness to stand up in defense of civil liberties and human rights even when such a defense  be viewed with disfavor by the world dominant military power the Daily Mail quoted Svallfors as saying


This year is also the  anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Martin Luther King It was revealed in September that the NSA spied on King And Obama referenced the civil rights leader in his recent NSA reform speech 


Snowden was slotted in at No  on Foreign Policy magazine list of the  Global Thinkers of  But he came in second to the pope for Time magazine Person of the Year award an outcome that subjected the publication to some ridicule


The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to  person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses


Here are the complete remarks sent by Solhjell and Valen to the Nobel Committee today as published by Norwegian blog Manifest Tidsskrift


We hereby nominate Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize


As former Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Corigan said  is more than simply the absence of war it is the active creation of something better Our leaders are not merely actors on a global stage of preserving self they are also political leaders whom we need to trust and hold accountable Their responsibilities go beyond realpolitik and zero games their actions have real consequences for real people


The new information technologies of the past few decades bring new possibilities for democratization transparency and freedom of expression But they also introduce new tools of oppression surveillance and espionage Massive surveillance of ordinary people communication and targeted surveillance against allied leaders is now possible on a scale that we wouldn be able to imagine two or three decades ago When democratic countries make widespread use of these possibilities without regard to people rights to free expression and the basic principles of the rule of law they undermine their own legitimacy and ability to effectively criticize and change the oppressive politics massive surveillance not to mention the censorship of authoritarian regimes


A peaceful world order depends on trust between nations and trust between people Peace brokering would be impossible without a basic level of trust International agreements on nonproliferation and disarmament would be impossible without a basic level of trust And peaceful resolutions to emerging security threats would be impossible without a basic level of trust


Edward Snowden has revealed the nature and technological prowess of modern surveillance The level of sophistication and depth of surveillance that citizens all over the world are subject to has stunned us and stirred debate all over the world By doing this he has contributed critical knowledge about how modern surveillance and intelligence directed towards states and citizens is carried out


There is no doubt that the actions of Edward Snowden may have damaged the security interests of several nations in the short term We do not necessarily condone or support all of his disclosures We are however convinced that the public debate and changes in policy that have followed in the wake of Snowden whistle have contributed to a more stable and peaceful world order His actions have in effect led to the reintroduction of trust and transparency as a leading principle in global security policies Its value can be overestimated


A country legitimate need for reliable intelligence to preserve its own security must always be balanced against the people individual freedoms  and the global need for trust  as an integral condition for stability and peace Edward Snowden has made a critical contribution to restoring this balance

   Greider Ph  one of the world pioneering researchers on the structure of ends known as telomeres today was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences The Academy recognized her for her  discovery of telomerase  an enzyme that maintains the length and integrity of chromosome ends and is critical for the health and survival of all living cells and organisms


  grEYE the Daniel Nathans Professor and Director of Molecular Biology and Genetics in the Johns Hopkins Institute for Basic Biomedical Sciences shares this year prize with Elizabeth Blackburn a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California San Francisco and Jack Szostak Ph of Harvard Medical School who discovered that telomeres are made up of simple repeating blocks of DNA building blocks and that they are found in all organisms Greider Blackburn and Szostak shared the  Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for this work


 profoundly important work its impact on science and its increasing implications for human health exemplify the Johns Hopkins mission in advancing knowledge for the sake of our world says Edward D Miller M Dean and CEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine  are pleased that the Nobel Foundation has chosen to honor her and we offer her our heartiest congratulations


 the most prestigious award in the world the Nobel Prize has been awarded for achievements in physics chemistry physiology or medicine literature and peace since  by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm Sweden Drs Greider Blackburn and Szostak each will receive a medal and diploma and will share a cash award of  million Kroner  million USD at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec 


 is a wonderful moment says Johns Hopkins University President Ron Daniels only for Dr Greider but also for all of us here at Johns Hopkins who share in her passion for discovery and her zeal for putting knowledge to work for the good of humanity We are thrilled by this magnificent accomplishment of Carol and her colleagues and even more so by the implications of her continuing work for our understanding of such complex problems as cancer and aging Carol has advanced scientific knowledge immeasurably but remains unsatisfied and wants to know more That is the Johns Hopkins way


 time a cell divides its chromosomes become a little shorter As cells age their telomeres shorten The consequent loss of telomere function will cause some cells to stop dividing or die and others to undergo chromosome rearrangements that can lead to cancer


 Blackburn and Szostak performed their groundbreaking investigations in the late  and the  Blackburn showed that simple repeated DNA sequences make up chromosome ends and with Szostak established that these repeated sequences stabilize chromosomes and prevent them from becoming damaged Szostak and Blackburn predicted the existence of an enzyme that would add the sequences to chromosome termini


 a graduate student with Blackburn who was then a member of the faculty at UC Berkeley Greider tracked down the enzyme telomerase She later determined that each organism telomerase contains an RNA component that serves as a template for the creature particular telomere DNA repeat sequence In addition to providing insight into how chromosome ends are maintained Blackburn Greider and Szostak work laid the foundation for studies that have linked telomerase and telomeres to human cancer and age conditions


 delighted Greider thanked the Nobel Foundation for the award and emphasized that the recognition highlights the value of  driven by pure curiosity We had no idea when we started this work that telomerase would be involved in cancer but were simply curious about how chromosomes stayed intact


 intrigues basic scientists like me is that any time we do a series of experiments there are going to be three or four new questions that come up when you think you answered one Our approach shows that while you can do research that tries to answer specific questions about a disease you can also just follow your nose


 with a single pond organism called Tetrahymena Greider said these organisms  rather than primates or humans  were the best test system because Tetrahymena contain  like  chromosomes compared to our  pairs and thus have far more chromosome ends to study


 most far discoveries are the product of basic research says Stephen Desiderio M Ph director of the Institute for Basic Biomedical Sciences at Johns Hopkins  are thrilled that Carol is being recognized for her work which reminds us that science is most powerful when it is driven by curiosity


 Greider  grew up in Davis Calif where her father was a physicist at the University of California Greider credits her parents for her decision to go into science and her father for influencing her attitude about academic science  father would talk about academic freedom and the importance of liking what you do He would say  can do whatever you want but you have to like whatever you do


 graduated from the University of California Santa Barbara with a B in biology in  and earned a Ph in molecular biology in  from the University of California Berkeley She worked at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island N from  to first as a postdoctoral fellow then an associate investigator She moved to Johns Hopkins in 


 at Cold Spring Harbor Greider working with Calvin Harley at McMaster University realized that unlike most cells in the adult human body cancer cells contain active forms of telomerase that enable cells to keep dividing by maintaining the length of their chromosome ends Together in  they provided early evidence that telomere length was related to cellular aging They found that telomerase is activated in cancer cells which allows these cells to bypass cellular senescence and continue growing as immortalized cells


 two researchers began to imagine a treatment for cancer in which the telomerase could be inhibited long enough to wipe out the telomeres in the malignant cells This would trigger death in the cancer cells but not in normal ones with their longer telomeres


 work using cultured human cells and mice genetically engineered to lack the gene for telomerase confirmed that inhibition of telomerase can limit cancer cell division and tumor production


 continues to study the role of telomeres in DNA damage and cell death Recently she and her colleagues developed a mouse model for a rare inherited disorder related to stem cell failure  called dyskeratosis congenita  that is caused by mutations in telomerase People with dyskeratosis congenita cannot maintain the telomerase in their bone marrow and eventually die of bone marrow failure  the studies that we had done on the consequences of telomerase loss were pertinent to this disease Greider says  another example of curiosity research ending up having a direct medical implication


 is currently working on mouse models she helped develop to understand how telomerase may play a role in both cancer and stem cell failure This might lead to a clearer link between aging and telomeres she says  don believe that aging is going to be a matter of just one thing that there going to be one gene that controls all of aging I think there are going to be multiple different failures and that the loss of stem cells can play a role in a number of them


 Greider profoundly important work its impact on science and its increasing implications for human health exemplify the Johns Hopkins mission in advancing knowledge for the sake of our world says Edward D Miller M the dean of medical faculty and CEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine  are pleased that the Nobel Foundation has chosen to honor her and we offer her our heartiest congratulations


 director Jeremy M Berg Ph adds  by curiosity Dr Greider and her colleagues answered fundamental questions about a basic biological process now known to be involved in cancer and cellular aging Their work has been an important breakthrough for many fields and offers a classic example of how basic non research can illuminate our understanding of health and disease in unforeseen ways Prior to Berg appointment at NIGMS he directed the Institute for Basic Biomedical Sciences at Johns Hopkins where he served on the faculty from
