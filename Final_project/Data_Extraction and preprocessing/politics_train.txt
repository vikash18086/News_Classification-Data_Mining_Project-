Watchdog probes e mail deletions    The information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e mails more than three months old     Richard Thomas  totally condemned  the deletion of e mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on  January  Government guidance said e mails should only be deleted if they served  no current purpose  Mr Thomas said  The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules     Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e mail retention  On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry  The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was  too unlikely to have been a coincidence  Mr Beith said  But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or  the destruction of important records   Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the  e mail regime  could  support the freedom of information regime      Mr Thomas said   The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence   He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor  All e mails are subject to the freedom of information laws but the important thing was the content of the e mail said Mr Thomas      If in doubt retain that has been the long standing principle of the civil service and public authorities  Its only when youve got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it   But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned   The Freedom of Information Act will cover England Wales and Northern Ireland from next year  Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland  It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about  public bodies subject to various exemptions  Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner

Hewitt decries career sexism    Plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labours election manifesto the Trade and Industry Secretary has said     Patricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated but it was an  increasingly high priority  and a  shared goal across government   Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission EOC  Mothers can currently take up to six months paid leave   and six unpaid  Ms Hewitt told the seminar   Clearly one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months   We are looking at how quickly we can do that because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that      Ms Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential  Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and  taster courses  for men and women in non traditional jobs  Women in full time work earn   less than men according to the Equal Opportunities Commission EOC     The minister told delegates that getting rid of  career sexism  was vital to closing the gender pay gap      Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential   It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex  she said  Earlier she told BBC Radio  Today programme   What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of  women work in jobs that are low paid and typically dominated by women so we have got very segregated employment   Unfortunately in some cases this reflects very old fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women or indeed for men   Career sexism is about saying that engineering for instance where only   of employees are women is really a male dominated industry  Construction is even worse   But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men  Career sexism goes both ways      She added that while progress had been made there was still a gap in pay figures   The average woman working full time is being paid about  for every pound a man is earning  For women working part time it is    The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC     It has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies  Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of  natural differences  between the sexes  Women hold less than   of the top positions in FTSE  companies the police the judiciary and trade unions according to their figures  And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average

Drink remark acts as diversion    The first ministers statement that it was okay to get drunk  once in a while  has diverted attention from the real issues it has been claimed     Jack Law chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland said Jack McConnells comment was  ill advised   The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotlands binge drinking problems Mr Law said  Scotsman journalist Hamish MacDonell said he believed the bigger picture had been  obscured  by the remark  Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than  secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions     The one sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk  But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were  a recognition that people will get drunk   Mr MacDonell political editor of The Scotsman said   I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill advised remark by the first minister   If you come out with something like this saying that by all means get drunk then you will be pilloried for it   However he added that  perhaps Mr McConnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage      Mr MacDonell said   I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking   But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence  I understand why but I think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured   Mr Law from voluntary body Alcohol Focus Scotland believed damage had been done to Scotlands fight against binge drinking  He said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink  Mr Law added   I think the remark was ill advised   but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in Scotland      We dont want to preach to young people but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically   This diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness   He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk  Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were  off the mark  they were bound to  come back and bite him   He added   Here Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to  teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters   I think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark      The Scottish National Partys Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his  ill judged comment  and withdraw it immediately  In a furious response the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context  He told Ms Sturgeon   It is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that I should encourage young people to get drunk   That is completely untrue  Perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position undermine the convener of education at Highland Council and insult the intelligence of the young people I spoke with   all for the sake of a simple soundbite

Concerns at school diploma plan    Final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for Englands secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report     The governments response to the plan for a four tier diploma to replace all existing   qualifications is expected next week  Some are worried it could be scuppered if as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested GCSEs and A levels stay  Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week  He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week  But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday   It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half hearted response  said the chairman of the Commons education select committee Labour MP Barry Sheerman     His main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma   but only to replace existing vocational qualifications   We must tackle head on the structural mess that is our secondary education system  he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement   It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak   The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority QCA has also told the government not to  compromise   The QCA said the potential  step change in participation and attainment  lay in the integrity of the whole diploma   Any partial implementation of the proposals would in our view compromise that integrity  said its chairman Sir Anthony Greener  It is a sign of the QCAs concern that its advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently  But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills  They may be content if it does not  close too many doors  in writing   whatever spin is put on it     The chief inspector of schools David Bell also said recently that GCSEs and A levels should go   One of the reasons why Im so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that its good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system  he said   If we dont say this is a sea change in education we will miss a great opportunity   Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students  A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers organisation the CBI which complains of a lack of skills  In an attempt to address this the Tomlinson plan is for tests in  functional  maths and literacy   decidedly not GCSEs  It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms concerns on this score  Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinsons predecessor as chief schools inspector Professor Chris Woodhead who has said there is no need for such a  massive upheaval   The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A level grade no matter how well the others have done

Student fee factor played down    A rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland     However Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out  Applications from England and Wales rose by   between January  and the previous year up  to   Fears had been expressed that a flood of  fee refugees  would try to avoid top up fees of up to    a year being introduced in England  In June last year Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by    in an attempt to prevent a cross border flood although no figure has yet been agreed  Legislation to introduce the top up fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn  and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all     The figures were made public on Thursday by admissions service Ucas  Universities Scotland which represents university principals claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to Scottish students being squeezed out  Director David Caldwell said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities but this was not a major factor  He told BBC Radio Scotlands Good Morning Scotland programme   The reason people are opting for Scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality they offer very attractive courses and Scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study      They know that when they take up their studies in  they will be hit by top up fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated   However it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here   Mr Wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context  He explained that when applications were translated into acceptances the number was not huge   an additional figure of about      Also the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from Wales where there are no plans for top up fees have also risen by    Mr Wallace said   Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held not just in Britain   We want to make sure that when students are making their choice they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland   We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option   Very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students

Anglers could face prosecution    Anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty a committee of MPs has warned     Sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended the environment select committee said  The MPs said they were  concerned  the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare  They raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved MPs said     They called for a  cast iron guarantee  that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing  The draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation and intends to protect  kept animals  and  companion  animals by setting up a  duty of care   In addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible  The bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing  mutilation  of animals   unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animals best interest     The environment select committee made  recommendations after hearing evidence from  organisations and individuals  One was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged   even if they were to later fail   We accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the governments intention to exempt fishing as an activity      But the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought   However in exempting fishing the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given carte blanche to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity  the committee added  The committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill such as the law on abandonment of animals which  would be significantly weakened   MPs urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences  This was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted   such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect or unnecessary mental suffering   to go unpunished     Committee chairman Michael Jack said   Any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest   This draft bill is no exception  My committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesnt just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place   But Mr Jack said the bill  very much had the feel of a work in progress and urged the government to guarantee that  an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law  before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs circuses and game bird farms   The government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to Parliament  he added

MPs criticise child access system    Divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system MPs have said     The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access  Courts should be used as a last resort but where they are their orders should be enforced more rigorously MPs said  But they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access     Currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount   An arbitrary template imposed on all families whatever the needs of the child would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position  the MPs said     They said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non resident parent in contested cases  This would  reassert the rights of non resident parents to contact with their children as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety  they said  Delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed  a new status quo arrangement for the children to become established by default  they said      Although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias there are considerable grounds for accepting that non resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present   Given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents   Committee chairman Alan Beith said the five month inquiry had been a  complex and emotive  one   At the moment far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation  he said   This situation has to change  The court system should only be used as a last resort where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with   This will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country

Debate needed on donations cap    A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet the elections watchdog has said     Fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit  In a new report the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a    cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it  It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning     There were almost    in reported donations to political parties in   and  with nearly    of them from individual gifts worth more than     The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions  The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash   something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work   While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible  says its report  If there was to be a cap it should be      a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned    in donations between  and      Even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under     It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to    so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons European Parliament Scottish Parliament Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly  And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning seen as a way of improving voter turnout  All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets says the watchdog  And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters     The report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates while cutting national spending limits from    to     The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll   as happens with other elections  Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said   There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced   Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible   The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations   He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system

Muslims discuss election concerns    Issues that Muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by UK community representatives     The event is being held by the Muslim Association of Britain MAB which believes Muslim voters could influence the result in up to  constituencies  Last year MAB which opposed the war in Iraq urged Muslims not to vote for Labour in the European elections  But a spokesman stressed the meeting was  not necessarily anti Labour    This meeting is not anti party in particular its anti policy its on the issues we are going to ask Muslims to vote on  MAB spokesman Dr Azzam Tamimi said of Tuesdays event      There are issues of concern to Muslims and Muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues   Dr Tamimi said the main issues Muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on Iraq the Palestinian situation the erosion of civil liberties for Muslims in the UK and economic social and education problems     Approximately   of the UKs   Muslims are of voting age  Previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted Labour but more recent studies have suggested Labour support has been falling away significantly among some Muslim voters     Anger over the war in Iraq has appeared to be the main reason with many saying it was  unjustified   Representatives from a number of Muslim organisations will attend Tuesdays event  Among them will be the Muslim Council of Britain MCB  The chairman of the MCBs public affairs committee Sher Khan said the war in Iraq would be a  significant factor  affecting Muslims voting intentions   I think its going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact  Mr Khan said     However Professor John Curtice of the University of Strathclyde is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by Muslims could make   For the most part the Labour constituencies where theres a large Muslim community are relatively safe but there are one or two that are not quite so safe  Professor Curtice said     The constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green in east London and Rochdale in Lancashire he added  In Bethnal Green former Labour MP George Galloway who founded the anti war party Respect is standing against sitting MP Oona King who had a  vote majority in   In Rochdale the Liberal Democrats   the mainstream party a  ICM survey showed was benefiting most from Muslim disaffection with Labour   secured second place in the  election securing just under  votes fewer than Labours Lorna Fitzsimons  But Professor Curtice said the Muslim anti war vote could be split between the Liberal Democrats and Respect meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box   Ironically the Tories might be the beneficiaries if Labour does lose seats which is generally the case  he said  But Dr Tamimi said MABs intention was not to  empower  the Tories   We know the next government will be Labour but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly   If the next Labour government has a reduced majority thats a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country  Dr Tamimi said

Fido to be taken off vote lists    The risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote the UK elections watchdog has said     Those are some of the mistakes found under the current system where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants  The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud  Voters need to register by  March if the next poll is on  May as expected  But any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in Britain before that general election     The proposed scheme would mean voters using individual  identifiers  when they vote   such as their own voting number date of birth and signature  The Electoral Commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws  Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process   which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system  There have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll the MPs heard  And some people have registered all their family regardless of their age   birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check  Non British citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases     Mr Younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes  He argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at  hard to reach  voters for example  Some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out  Mr Younger said using the Royal Mails postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about  voters     He argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting  There have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form  He said it might also help register students in halls of residences where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody  The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover  He said the Northern Ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted  Currently British voters have to re register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running  Mr Younger suggested the re registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up to date

Howard backs stem cell research    Michael Howard has backed stem cell research saying it is important people are not frightened of the future     The controversial issue was a feature of the recent US presidential election where George Bush opposed extending it  But the Tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of Alzheimers Parkinsons and Motor Neurone disease   I believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses  he said  The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed  Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the bodys tissue types  Scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney heart or even brain tissue     Mr Howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research  But he argued   We mustnt be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past   we must be optimistic about the future   Politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind   With the life expectancy of the average Briton now around the mid  society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of peoples lives as they grow older   I know many people are concerned about stem cell research  They are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls   I respect those concerns  But I also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like Parkinsons Multiple Sclerosis Motor Neurone Disease Alzheimers and   as we saw in the papers today   now possibly heart problems      Mr Howard acknowledged there were  no easy answers  over such an issue but it was necessary to  have the courage to do what we know to be morally right   He added   Of course stem cells are still a recent discovery  More research needs to be done  But we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown up way  The hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved   Former Superman actor the late Christopher Reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident  Mr Howard made his remarks during a speech in Westminster to the Conservative National Womens Committee on ambitions and values

Howard unveils Tory asylum plans    Tory plans to cut immigration to the UK are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees Michael Howard has said     As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs  There would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas  Some charities say the plans would put refugees lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled     Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans   By cutting the number of front line immigration staff at our borders they will actually make the problem worse  said Mr Blair  Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick fair and firm asylum system  But he said it was  absolutely disgusting  to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees  The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set     In a speech in London on Monday Mr Howard said   Its not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it   He said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that  firm but fair  immigration controls were essential for good community relations          Withdrawing from the  United Nations Convention on refugees which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need not numbers      Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents      Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK   a worry for  national security       Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps  Anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin         The Tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an Australian style points system and those wanting to join families in the UK     Mr Howard said nearly  people were settling in the UK every year   the size of a city like Peterborough  The plans would help achieve a  substantial reduction  in immigration he said although he could not predict a figure  He said that only two out of  asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current  unfair and inhumane  system      We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum  Mr Howard said   By breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling      But the UN refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees  And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case  Refugee Council Chief Executive Maeve Sherlock called the plans  dangerous ill thought out and hugely irresponsible   Lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled she warned  Commission for Racial Equality chairman Trevor Phillips said asylum applications were down   and economic migration down about       He did not think Mr Howard intended to centre the debate about race  But he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture  Mr Howard called that suggestion  disgraceful

Campaign cold calls questioned    Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing  cold calls      The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing   for instance by asking about peoples voting intentions  The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls  The information commissioners office says surveys are allowed but there is a  grey  area if personal data is kept  Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run up to the general election     But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service TPS lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls  Both schemes are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directives on privacy and electronic communications     The rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies  But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS  A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising  But that did not happen for  voter identification  calls   When we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not  he said   So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service      He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again  A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers  She said   We do apply TPS but in line with the law  We would not do things that are not allowed in the law   A spokesman for the Information Commissioners Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them  But the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics not person by person   If a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing  he said     The spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future  The spokesman said there was  no yes or no  answer and the area was  pretty grey   He added   If someone complained then we would investigate that  Political parties are aware of the regulations  At the last by elections we reminded them   Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has now written to the watchdog saying   The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal   He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are  significant  numbers of such calls   I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases  he tells the commissioner  Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them

Tory leader quits legal position    David McLetchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role     The Scottish Conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with Tods Murray did not influence the causes he supports  But on Friday he said   I have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect   Mr McLetchie had received advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare  Labour said he had  cleverly  not asked about paid advocacy  A Tory spokesman  totally refuted  any wrongdoing     Mr McLetchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport  The MSP had been a partner for Tods Murray which has a client opposing the development  Mr McLetchie did not have a complaint made against him but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position  He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong     Explaining his reason for quitting the post Mr McLetchie said   I have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with Tods Murray   However I have no wish to see a similar situation arise again   To avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of Tods Murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled I have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year   I am proud to have been a part of Tods Murray for the last  years and wish it well in the future      Labour MSP Christine May had said Mr McLetchie was  very clever  to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section  of the code   He was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section  the section on paid advocacy  she said  Section  of the members interest order legally obliges MSPs to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings  where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner   However MSPs Code of Conduct  recognises a wider definition  of parliamentary proceedings including a non statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices such as motions     But a letter from Holyroods Chamber Office chief Ken Hughes also made clear that Mr McLetchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor  Commenting on Mr McLetchies decision to stand down a Scottish Labour Party spokesman said   This should mean Mr McLetchie doesnt breach the paid advocacy rules in future   However it doesnt change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past      Scottish National Party Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Mr McLetchie of failing to properly serve his constituents  Ms Sturgeon said   I think this whole episode has been very damaging for Mr McLetchie and Im sure he will be reflecting on it   She added that she thought that the Tories were an irrelevant party so she would not  lose any sleep over it   Peter Misselbrook executive partner of Tods Murray said Mr McLetchie had been considering retirement later in the year  He added   David has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so

It is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP  Robert Kilroy Silk could have a lot to offer  Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause  Under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation  Last summer UKIP achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to Kilroy Silk  It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in fighting     UKIP has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the EU  This Kilroy Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party  Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes  Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy Silk     If he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another     So UKIP was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow!    Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!    Every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti Europe feeling in this country  Kilroy Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue  He is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience  We wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes  It needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians  Kilroy Silk may just have those very qualities  Recruit the right colleagues Robert and your time may have come!    Well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up your own Party  Its all flash and no real policy here    Lets hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy Silk slipping into obscurity     Veritas The name will doom it  But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn Latin in the classroom do they not The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism so explain to me how the too twee label of Veritas symbolises that

New drink limit would cut toll    More lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink drive limits by a third a report says     University College London research claims cutting the limit from  of alcohol per  of blood to  would save  lives a year  The findings are being published by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety as MPs are due to vote on the governments Road Safety Bill  The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink drive limit  The research carried out by transport expert professor Richard Allsop says cutting the limit would also lead to  fewer serious injuries on the UKs roads compared with   He estimates that this would save the country    a year     A previous estimate contained in a  Department of Transport Document suggested such a move could save  lives a year  The findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking  Professor Allsop said   Reducing the limit from  to  can be expected to save around  lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the drivers BAC  blood alcohol content  is within  of the current limit   Only about one in  of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times      Ministers do not support a lower limit saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties  They believe educating drivers is more important  The AA Motoring Trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers attitudes to drink driving  Road safety head Andrew Howard said   It remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut      Parliamentarians need to consider this carefully  Britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone   Liberal Democrat transport spokesman John Thurso said drink driving remained a  major killer  with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking  He said there had been a   drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since  which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink driving  The Road Safety Bill which gets its second reading on Tuesday would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court   currently a blood test is needed  It also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over  These have been criticised by road safety campaigners including Labour backbencher Gwyneth Dunwoody who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas leading to more road casualties  In an article for the Times newspaper Ms Dunwoody who chairs the Transport Select Committee says   Slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists   It is quite simple  if you hit someone at  they have a  per cent chance of survival  If you are going at  nine times out of ten they will die

Wales must learn health lessons    The new health minister for Wales says there are lessons to learn from England in tackling waiting lists     Dr Brian Gibbons on his first full day in the job after Jane Hutt was sacked admitted  big challenges  but insisted the  essentials  were in place  But both Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats said Dr Gibbons needed to change policy  Meanwhile Ms Hutt defended her record saying waiting times and lists were  only   of the health agenda  Dr Gibbons who was a GP in Blaengwynfi in the Upper Afan Valley before becoming AM for Aberavon said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after  tremendous change and reform   One of the biggest problems which had faced Ms Hutt during her five and a half years as the assemblys first health minister was the length of waiting lists in Wales     In November the British Medical Association said NHS staff were  weeping with despair  as figures showed  people were waiting for treatment in Wales up by  on the previous month  In the same month lists in England were at their lowest for  years with  people waiting for treatment  Dr Gibbons told Radio Wales   There is no doubt that in managing waiting lists England has done a lot of very very useful work and we do need to learn from that      But he said the NHS in Wales also needed to create a healthier population rather than respond only to ill health and a balanced view of priorities was important   We do need a consistent across the board approach recognising the patients experience of how they use the service is going to be at the end of the day the main test of how the service is working   He said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after  tremendous change and reform   Later Dr Gibbons praised the work of Ms Hutt saying he  agreed with everything shes done  to change the health service in Wales  Dr Gibbons said he accepted there was a problem but his job now was to build on the foundations put in place by his predecessor  He also acknowledged that until the waiting list issue was sorted out the rest of the assembly governments health policy would be overshadowed     Opposition members and some Labour MPs had long called for Ms Hutts removal after sustained criticism over extended hospital waiting times  First Minister Rhodri Morgan told BBC Wales he had agreed with Ms Hutt in  that she would not be health minister in the run up to the  elections   Shes been doing the job for five years and eight months and apart from Nye Bevan himself architect of the NHS I dont think anybody has ever done the job for so long   Mr Morgan said he had only told Ms Hutt of the reshuffle on Monday morning and said the NHS in Wales was Dr Gibbons  baby  now  In response to Dr Gibbons comments Ieuan Wyn Jones leader of the Plaid Cymru group in the assembly said   It is apparent that this reshuffle by the first minister was just changing the deckchairs on a sinking Titanic   Kisrty Williams for the Lib Dems added   If the underlying policy is going to continue then changing the minister will serve no purpose other than to deflect flak from Labours MPs  she said  Meanwhile Ms Hutt said she hoped  that the people of Wales would benefit from my investment of the past five years and eight months  Asked about waiting lists she said that waiting times and lists were  only   of the health agenda  and that the Welsh Assembly Government had  turned the corner  on the issue

Minister defends hunting ban law    The law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales is enforceable and  very clear  Alun Michael has said     The rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law which came into force on Friday and pretended they were not  Some  hunts met legally on Saturday killing a total of  foxes   only four were accidentally killed by hounds  But anti hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts  Countryside Alliance chairman John Jackson said that Saturday had been a  massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting   People had turned out  to show en masse that the Hunting Act was a bad law  he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed  legally  as far as he was aware     Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence exercising hounds chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal  Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable Mr Michael told BBC Radio  Today Programme   There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting   The reality is that the law is very clear  You cant chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer   If people do so and pretend theyre not its going to become very clear  You cant hunt accidentally   Mr Michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities  He said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy the health service and their childrens future than hunting     But the League Against Cruel Sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen  Thousands of hunt supporters turned out at  hunts across England and Wales on the first day of the ban with anti hunt groups sending out  monitors to check the law was not being broken  There were only four arrests   over alleged hunting of hares in Wiltshire   although it was not clear whether they were made under the Hunting Act     They have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws  But Penny Little who monitored the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire said she had witnessed  gratuitous spiteful killing of foxes   If people tried to  run circles around this law  the only outcome would be that it was tightened up she said  Mike Hobday from the League Against Cruel Sports said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police  He said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti hunt activists videoing hunts  But Mr Jackson who had been at the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire denied there was any intimidation

Police urge pub closure power    New powers are needed to close disorderly pubs bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently police chiefs have told MPs     Association of Chief Police Officers president Chris Fox said the current  hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords  Mr Foxs comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock  He rejected critics calls for the law change to be delayed  Instead the new Licensing Act could help reduce drunken disorder   but only if it was properly planned he argued     Acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the Commons home affairs select committee  After the meeting Mr Fox said being able to close premises for only  hours did not necessarily make an impact   If its   on a Saturday morning and you close for  hours theres not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldnt open on Sunday anyway      This is about getting through to the management that they cant run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions   Under Acpos proposal the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority  The new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs   but only for  hour periods     Mr Fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself   Its making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse and the strategic planning process has been less than useless  he said  Mr Fox said the new laws due to start being phased in next month could help if food outlets public transport and public toilets could cope with late night drinkers   Staggering it closing hours will be a solution if the infrastructure is there if the premises are properly managed and people arent being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street  he said   We have the problem from  to  in any event  We have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this      Acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs  Home Secretary Charles Clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing  The licensing changes have sparked concern among some MPs councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems  Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell on Tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes  It was the status quo not the new laws which were causing current binge drinking problems she told BBC Twos Newsnight  Leaked documents have suggested ex Home Secretary David Blunkett branded new opening hours as a  leap in the dark   But Ms Jowell insisted his concerns had been met  The polices job against alcohol related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time she added

MPs murder sentence concern    Murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea says a new MPs report     The influential Commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer  The MPs also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs  They say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders  Committee chairman John Denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse      The committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor   At present judges when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence can reduce the tariff   the minimum term they must serve   if the defendant pleads guilty  But although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims relatives are unhappy  In July this year Amanda Champions killer James Ford pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least  years   it would have been longer had he denied the charge     Amandas uncle Lewis Champion told the BBC News website Ford did not deserve any credit for his plea saying   Nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence   MPs criticised Home Secretary David Blunkett last year for introducing last minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty     The measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after Mr Blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the Criminal Justice Bill     As a result says the committee the government may need to re legislate to  remove ambiguity  over how murderers should be sentenced  It is also calling on the senior judge in England and Wales Lord Woolf to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in September to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty  The committee said the plans had not reflected the  public disquiet  expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers  Lord Woolfs Sentencing Guidelines Council SGC caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime  As a result murderers who face a  year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police     Mr Denham believes the SGC should reconsider its proposals to reflect Parliaments wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence  He said   We want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances   But a spokesman for the Home Office defended the proposals  He said   By making express provision for murder tariffs in the Criminal Justice Act Parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences   We stand by the provisions in the Act that cover guilty plea discounts which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial      Shadow home secretary David Davis echoed criticisms of the way Mr Blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules   There is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences   such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the governments claim to be tough on crime  he said  But Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten warned the MPs committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference   The danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful it is also different  he told BBC News

No one can define new hunt ban    The new law banning hunting with dogs is  so poorly drafted  no one can define the offence pro hunt MPs say     The accusation came after it emerged a Devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to  chase away unwanted animals  from his farm  Because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting  Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting   chasing away   and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules     North Devon landowner Giles Bradshaw was put in touch with the Middle Way Group of which Mr Opik is a co chairman after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry Defra  He had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the Hunting Act  Mr Bradshaw was initially told it was an offence   prompting him to complain  The Middle Way group also said Mr Bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free  In a later conversation Mr Bradshaw was told that according to Defras lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was  not in fact hunting as described in the Hunting Act  therefore you would not be committing an offence      Mr Opik said   Hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the Hunting Act   Now Defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting   chasing away which isnt even covered by the Act   However all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals   How is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting exempt hunting drag hunting unintentional hunting a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away  Tory MP Peter Luff another co chairman of Middle Way said that the legislation was  so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence       It is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law  However I seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating   Mike Hobday of the League Against Cruel Sports said   There is no confusion it is a matter of simple common sense   If Mr Bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence   If all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer then nobody can define that as hunting

Falconer rebuts charade claims    Concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia  through the back door  were not a political ploy the lord chancellor has said     Ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the Mental Capacity Bill amid chaotic scenes in the Commons on Tuesday  Lord Falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer  He said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some MPs argue the situation is still unclear     The bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves  Ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards  Critics fear it could allow  killing by omission  through withdrawing treatment including food and fluids     Tony Blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill  But changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from Hillsborough coma victim Tony Bland   It is important we dont end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen  he said     On Tuesday the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by  votes to  despite rebellion by  Labour MPs  The revolt was also reduced by news that Lord Falconer had promised the Catholic archbishop of Cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill  But that only came after MPs bombarded Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark  Eventually he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes prompting claims of a shambles  The deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been     Lord Falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the House of Lords  He told BBC News   We have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life   The motive has got to be to end suffering   He denied the concessions were a  political manoeuvre  forced by panic about the rebellion  It was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through Parliament but the result was a  sensible solution  he said   I dont think it is something to be embarrassed about  These issues are not easy to deal with  he went on  BBC political editor Andrew Marr said Mr Lammy was  waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast  after his performance  But Lord Falconer praised his minister for an  excellent job   Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith one of the chief critics of the plans condemned the debate as a  charade  and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague

New rules tackle sham weddings    New rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the UK are coming into force     From Tuesday most non EU citizens will need Home Office approval to marry  The Home Office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages of which there are estimated to be up to  a year  But immigrants group the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants JCWI says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge  When the changes were unveiled last year immigration minister Des Browne said   Our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages while providing firm controls to prevent abuse   Under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the UK only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give  days notice of the wedding at the local register office     But from Tuesday all non EU nationals apart from citizens of Switzerland Liechtenstein Iceland or Norway intending to wed in the UK must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a Home Office certificate of marriage approval  To get a certificate costing    applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the UK  Those without a settled status such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application will have no right to marry in the UK     Once they have the necessary documentation those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in England or Wales must register their intention to marry at one of  specially designated register offices  They can however marry at the register office or church of their choice  Rhian Beynon of the JCWI said the new rules were  not proportionate  and  discriminatory       These rules means in some cases the Home Secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort   Were currently taking a legal opinion on this  Well be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and well be looking at taking a case on this to the Human Rights Court  Ms Beynon said  The new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights  In a report published last July the cross party committee stated there was a  significant risk  the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were  disproportionate   The committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the Human Rights Act on the grounds of religion belief and nationality the report added     Over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions  In January  people who took part in a sham marriage network based in Leicester were jailed for a total of  years  And last November Samuel Amoah a Belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the UK was jailed for three years  Several other cases are currently going through the courts  The role of registrars who under the Asylum and Immigration Act  were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Office has been key in many prosecutions  Registrars spokesman Mark Rimmer said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent   They will effectively remove most of the blatant cases  Certainly those who are illegals in this country of which we had quite a few will no longer be getting married  Mr Rimmer said  Mr Rimmer the service director for registrations of marriages at Brent Council in north west London said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties   It may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly its still not as difficult to marry in the UK than it is to marry for example in Holland Germany or France   I think its a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem  Mr Rimmer said

Woolf murder sentence rethink    Plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down     There was an outcry three months ago when the Sentencing Guidelines Council   led by Lord Woolf   published its proposals for England and Wales  It had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity  But that has now been changed to one sixth with no reduction for those killers given a  whole life tariff   At the time Lord Woolf the Lord Chief Justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances   for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected  The guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co operation he said     But director of the Victims of Crime Trust Norman Brennan accused Lord Woolf of having an  arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law abiding public   The National Association of Probation Officers said the move would be  political suicide   In revised proposals from the Sentencing Guidelines Council SGC the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be  weighed carefully  by a judge so they did not lead to  an inappropriately short sentence   Where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said     In a statement issued on Wednesday Lord Woolf said   I have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the SGC has vastly improved the final guidelines   I am confident as a result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending   Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald QC who sits on the SGC said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament   What the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process   It represents a tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity  he said

Sport betting rules in spotlight    A group of MPs and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport     The Parliamentary Group on Betting and Gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year  It followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport such as that done using the internet and mobile phones has led to more cheating  The all party group recommended  ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting  They include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years  Lord Condon head of the International Cricket Councils anti corruption unit who originally made the call for longer prison sentences said the two year penalty was  derisory    You could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports   Symbolically a higher penalty perhaps as the Bill passes through the two Houses might be appropriate      The report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters and for bookmakers to set up  audit trails    something the new betting exchanges already do   to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced     Lord Faulkner of Worcester who chaired the inquiry said   Whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges   because of the facility they provide to bet against a result   has increased the potential for corruption   It is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately   The panels aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right  As well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves  Betting exchanges allow punters to back to win but also lay to lose a horse  This means they can control their odds at winning by placing their money both ways

Once weve got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well  Its our way of putting the politicians on notice  We are trying to get across the fact that there are  voters over  in the country they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters  Before  most pensioners voted Conservative  In  and  they voted Labour  But there is no guarantee they will vote for a Labour government this time around  They cannot take that vote for granted     Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turners full report into the issue  He said the UK had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world     That the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment     We havent worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs  Various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing  We dont have any large demonstrations planned but they cant be ruled out     It is hard to say whether we will be successful  We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq     Repealing the Hunting Bill     We are challenging the use of the Parliament Act  in a High Court action  We are hoping to hear in the New Year  Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time  When the ban comes into force on  February we will be going to the European Court because no compensation is being paid  So theres a lot of legal territory to go  We are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking  Whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is  Rural affairs minister Alun Michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult  It is not intimidatory   on the whole it is groups of angry housewives  Of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything     It will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face  Its exactly what the prime minister did not want  He wanted the issue off the table until after the election     People using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad  The reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting  It is another sort of form of shooting for sport  The principle is the same whether its a tiger or a pheasant     We will widely publicise whats happening in relation to trophy hunting  We will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the UK  We will seek to get pledges from individual MPs and would be MPs saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports  We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors  With hunting we had many MPs who were happy to say they were against it     I think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda  Whether or not we will get a ban I am not sure  But it will mobilise public opinion  Everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban     The issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice  The language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum  Choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade  Its become an issue in itself but whats really missing from the debate is the consumers choice in that  Choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools  We have seen so many pensions mis selling scandals and in the pensions industry theres a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that  We want choice on the consumers terms   that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice     Firstly we have our website  It features our campaigns and changes every day  Secondly through our  members who communicate with us  Thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre election conference  We will invite the opinion formers MPs journalists and others  The idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians     I think we will be successful  Its very much the language being used by the main political parties  Politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue     Fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers  We have been hearing about this proposed increase of   per litre that Gordon Brown has been postponing and postponing  Tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle thats an increase of about     If youre running  vehicles its obviously  times that     If fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified  There will be a huge effect throughout the industry and I would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations  What it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business     We will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press  Regrettably its one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press  Whatever we do the public dont like lorries   they see us as a complaining minority  But they dont realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work when you see a lorry its already at work

Brown and Blair face new rift claims    For the umpteenth time Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are said to have declared all out war on each other     This time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the governments global aid and debt initiatives particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster   an issue many hoped and believed was above such things  It dominated the prime ministers monthly news conference which saw Mr Blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour  As he told journalists   I am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers  There is a complete unity of purpose   And he again heaped praise on Mr Brown saying he was doing a great job and would continue doing it   although he would not commit to any job for Mr Brown after the election     So why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with Mr Browns long arranged keynote speech on aid and debt he was asked By now Mr Blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting  He snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference  Well not really as it happens     And he repeated what a great man Gordon was and how united they were before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world  Although in the next breath he declared   I get increasingly alarmed by what I read in the newspapers  before catching himself on and quickly adding   In so far as I read them of course   He probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men     As far as the timing of the prime ministers press conference is concerned there are two options  The first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment  If that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling  The second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence which would suggest the government has lost its once famed ability to strictly co ordinate announcements   through the infamous Downing Street grid   to avert just such allegations     Either way the effect was the same   to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue  And there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men  Firstly the prime minister insisted on Wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get G countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami hit countries  It was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that Gordon Brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the governments response to the disaster while Mr Blair was still on holiday in Egypt     Then as if to pour fuel on the flames both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues Foreign Secretary Jack Straw Aid minister Hilary Benn and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott   without mentioning the other  All this came amid fresh claims that Mr Brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had as a result started to set out his own platform  The fact that he used an article in the Guardian newspaper to set out what he believed  should  be in the manifesto has embarked on a mini tour of Britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit Africa on the same mission   often seen as the prime ministers  turf    has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other  The prime minister denied all that as well repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign  But the big fear with many on the Labour benches now is that unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself

Blair said he would stand down    Tony Blair promised Gordon Brown he would stand down before the next election a new book about the chancellor claims     But the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the Cabinet according to the book  The book by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt  for each other  The book Browns Britain said Tony Blair felt by November  he had lost voters trust     The authors sources all unnamed  allies  of Mr Blair and Mr Brown said the prime minister felt the Iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party     The book serialised in the Sunday Telegraph alleges that Mr Blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy PM John Prescott in November  of his intention to stand down   At that stage he saw Gordon Brown and said look you are the next most influential member of the government I need your help to get through the next year  Mr Peston said   I myself recognise that Im going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and I will then stand down   But he changed his mind in June  following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him the book claims     Mr Peston told BBC News   My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were   What the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust mutual animosity   I think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private I dont think the relationship is good because Brown understandably feels deeply betrayed   particularly over this issue of the leadership   There has been fresh speculation of a rift recently following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami  Rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold Mr Blairs monthly media conference at the same time as a long planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new  Marshall Plan  for Africa  There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each others response to the disaster     Former welfare minister Frank Field MP criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on GMTVs Sunday Programme      What sort of model does it give to the nation when the two most important political leaders do nothing but fight it out together or use their aides to fight it out  the Labour MP for Birkenhead asked  He said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so  Conservative policy co ordinator David Cameron MP for Witney added   If it wasnt so serious it would be funny   But it is serious   youve got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime poverty or dirty hospitals   they are fighting each other   Carol Walker BBC News  political correspondent added   There is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign   And clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster

Blair dismisses quit claim report    Tony Blair has dismissed reports he told Gordon Brown he would quit before the next general election      You dont do deals over jobs like this  the prime minister told BBC Ones Breakfast with Frost programme  According to a new book Browns Britain Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June   Mr Blair said the claims were  reheated from six months ago  and that he was concentrating on running the country  Mr Blair said   Ive dealt with this six months ago  I said then you dont do deals over jobs like this   you dont      What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country   The book by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston and serialised in the newspaper said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt  for each other     It claims Tony Blair felt by November  he had lost voters trust because of the Iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party  And that at a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott he told Mr Brown of his intention to stand down  According to Mr Peston the prime minister said   Help me to get through the year and I will then stand down   But he then changed his mind in June  following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him according to the book     Mr Peston told BBC News   My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were   What the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust mutual animosity   I think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private I dont think the relationship is good because Brown understandably feels deeply betrayed   particularly over this issue of the leadership   But in a wide ranging BBC interview covering issues such as the Asian tsunami disaster the Middle East peace process and Northern Ireland Mr Blair said   When you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you   All sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter claims   He admitted to a  sense of frustration  about the allegations which he said had been made  countless times      There has been fresh speculation of a rift recently following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami  These rumours were fuelled by Mr Blairs decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new  Marshall Plan  for Africa  There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each others response to the disaster  But the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a  load of nonsense   Former welfare minister Frank Field MP said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so     Tory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of  squabbling like schoolboys   He told Sky News Sunday with Adam Boulton   This is the politics of the playground and Britain really does deserve better   The Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said the personal ambition of Mr Blair and Mr Brown was  getting in the way of good government    Either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election   During the interview Mr Blair also said the former home secretary David Blunkett would play a  big role  at the general election

Could rivalry overshadow election    Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle     Along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of Britain  It is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift  Ian Gibson for example urged the two men to stop squabbling declaring   For goodness sake sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can   Those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re election  Tony Blair will seek to reassure Labour MPs on Monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at Westminster   a behind closed doors meeting which Gordon Brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity     Meanwhile the likes of Health Secretary John Reid and Labour peer Lord Haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue  And they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison  Lord Haskins even suggested Mr Blair should reinstate Mr Brown as the central figure in the election planning     But this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage  They believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears  And it matters little whether the rift is real or as some try to suggest simply the product of newspaper headlines and Westminster gossip  Few in Westminster actually believe that simply because the evidence appears to contradict it     For example the weekends attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick  Even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments     Mr Blair talked about the  New  Labour manifesto   a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor who has long rejected the label  And Mr Brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year  That claim was repeated in Robert Pestons book a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive Downing Street soap opera is nowhere near its final act     For his part Mr Brown insists his only motivation was to get Labour re elected     The trouble is both men have fallen short of offering simple straightforward denials of the central claims  So they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour  The first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere  They started with and are sustained by  friends  of the two men  One only had to listen to the chancellors friend and former spin chief Charlie Whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime ministers apparent attempts to confound Mr Browns leadership ambitions  But it is not just public pronouncements from ex aides     There are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides  It is no secret in Westminster for example that Downing Street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner     Then there are the actions of the men themselves  Gordon Brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign  The prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor  Meanwhile large numbers of backbench MPs insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter which they believe is a media only obsession or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry  Either way there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the Labour party serious damage  There are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation  But with probably only four months to the next election that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off

Labour MPs fears over squabbling    If there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of Labour MPs it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election     And it was largely that fear that led to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party  The views expressed by both backbenchers and Labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely held view within the Labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election  As one hugely disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting   It is time they realised its not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt   It is a sentiment that is now running throughout the Labour benches with MPs eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand     As Paul Flynn said   What has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times when we wanted to come together we wanted to lead on the global issues to change politics for the next decade the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party two people we greatly respect      Stephen Pound echoed the message saying   We know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve not for the Labour Party but for this country is the appearance of division  We remember the    They backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be  named and shamed   The dressing down appears to have done the trick with Mr Brown joining his alleged rival Alan Milburn   who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in Mr Browns stead   and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at an election poster launch  But the effect of all this is to have achieved two things  Firstly nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors  Even Mr Prescott admitted that had he still been a backbencher he would have been giving Mr Blair and Mr Brown the same message     Secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has to all intents and purposes kicked off  But whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good   or can even be sustained through the campaign   remains to be seen     Even as the MPs were expressing their fears it emerged that while Mr Brown is in Africa for a week the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term  And he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be  New  Labour through and through  Similarly some were pointing out that the chancellor during the election poster launch once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said  None the less what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the Brown camp effectively strengthening the prime ministers hand  For example will those Brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime ministers timing or subject matter as may have been the case in the past What all seem agreed on however is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign  Mind you we have heard similar pledges before

Labour seeks to quell feud talk    Labours leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift     Mr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair  A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes  It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor     The event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Browns traditional poll planning role  But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task  Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister Mr Brown replied   You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy      He refused to comment on the new book saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government  Mr Brown later told reporters   Of course I trust the prime minister   Downing Street cited that comment when reporters suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair   There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe   Labours new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the  lowest unemployment for  years and the lowest mortgage rates for  years  They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards  Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign  which is upbeat confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country      Conservative co chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call saying   The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H   Labour had broken promises by raising taxes  times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English speaking world he said     The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Mondays meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Pestons new book  Mr Blair told MPs and peers   I know from everyone here in Cabinet and government nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need   Labours Paul Flynn said the pair had had a  scorching  from MPs     On Tuesday deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News   They told us very clearly it was the troops telling the leaders  get in line   The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November  where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war  Mr Blair then changed his mind in June  after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him writes Mr Peston  Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential   Of course as a waiter for  years I have a professional ability here  he joked

Labours election love in    Peace and love have been in short supply in the Labour party in recent days     If press reports are to be believed Alan Milburn and Gordon Brown have been at each others throats over the contents of Labours next election manifesto  But the pair were all smiles on Tuesday morning as they joined John Prescott to unveil Labours latest poster campaign  The event   at Old Billingsgate Fish Market on the banks of the Thames   was a carefully choreographed show of unity  And the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months  It was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years     The first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when   in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions   Labours speakers crackled to life with the sound of Booker T and the MGs  Then a VW camper van trundled into view decked out in that most mind bending of psychedelic messages    lowest mortgage rate for  years   As the side door slid open it looked for one glorious moment as if the Cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together Scooby Doo style  But sadly it wasnt the Cabinet who had raided the dressing up box   just six rather ill at ease looking Labour students  Two were dressed as Regency dandies   to unveil a poster trumpeting  the longest period of economic growth for  years   Another pair of students were in a Beatle wig and Sgt Pepper jacket to highlight the  lowest interest rates since the       The remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the  lowest unemployment since the seventies      The politicians   led out by John Prescott   were soberly suited as always  The event may have been designed to highlight Labours economic success under Mr Brown but there was little doubt who was in charge  The chancellor walked side by side with Mr Milburn pointedly exchanging chit chat as they approached the microphone  But it was Mr Milburn who took centre stage speaking of the  positive campaign  the party hoped to stage in the  coming weeks and months      The mobile poster vans would  let people know Britain is working again   Mr Brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of Labours  shared purpose  and  united dedication   It was left to Mr Prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellors record and in a final flourish to produce his famous pledge card from  claiming Labour has met all of its promises  The event was carefully stage managed to underline Cabinet unity  And more specifically to demonstrate the  central role  Mr Brown will play in the election campaign despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of Mr Milburn     But keen students of body language will have had a field day  There was much forced smiling for the cameras but only Mr Prescott who revels in such occasions seemed to be truly enjoying himself  Mr Milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor as he spoke nodding thoughtfully  But it was the former health secretarys final gesture placing an arm on Mr Browns back as they walked away from the microphones which was perhaps the most telling  Thanks for dropping by Gordon he might have been saying

Howard taunts Blair over splits    Tony Blairs feud with Gordon Brown is damaging the way the UK is governed Tory leader Michael Howard has claimed in a heated prime ministers questions     Mr Howard asked   How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other  That question was later unveiled as the headline for new Tory campaign posters  But Mr Blair dismissed the talk of splits and said peoples priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by Labour   He can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages low inflation low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to  he said  The chancellor is currently on a high profile tour of Africa to highlight new anti poverty plans  But before doing so he insisted he still trusted Mr Blair despite claims to the contrary in a new book     Browns Britain by Robert Peston says there is mutual animosity between the two men  It claims Mr Blair said in November  he would stand down as prime minister before the next election  But he went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him it says     Mr Pestons book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair   There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe   Mr Blair directly denied that quote on Wednesday  He again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit     The Tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor  He declared   He is the deals on meals prime minister  No wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater   He continued   How can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government how can they clean up our hospitals when they dont clean up their act  Mr Blair said he would not respond to  tittle tattle in books  and promised to hail Labours record on the economy waiting lists and law and order  from now until polling day   Later at their poster launch Tory co chairman Liam Fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how  juvenile  the prime minister and chancellor were     Labour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on Tuesday where Mr Brown was joined by Alan Milburn who Mr Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor  But Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy told BBC News   The government is clearly split at the top  This kind of cosmetic exercise does not persuade anybody   Later this week Mr Blair is expected to outline the direction of his partys next election manifesto  The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Mondays meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made Mr Pestons book

How political squabbles snowball    Its become commonplace to argue that Blair and Brown are like squabbling school kids and that they and their supporters need to grow up and stop bickering     But this analysis in fact gets it wrong  Its not just children who fight   adults do too  And there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going  The key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree theyd be better off if it ended   but everyone wants to have the last word     Each participant genuinely wants the row to stop but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard  Their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on  In the case of Mr Blair and Mr Brown successive books are published ensuring the issues never die  Now this isnt because the participants are stupid   its actually each individual behaving entirely rationally given the incentives facing them  Indeed theres even a piece of economic theory that explains all this  Nothing as obscure as  post neo classical endogenous growth theory  which the chancellor himself once quoted   but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with     Its often referred to as the  prisoners dilemma  based on a parable much told in economics degree courses    about a sheriff and two prisoners  The story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime and are locked up in separate cells  But the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime  Without a confession the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge     Clearly the prisoners best strategy is to keep their mouths shut and take the short sentence but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk  He tells each prisoner separately that if they confess   and they are the only one to confess   theyll be let off their crime  And he tells them that if they dont confess   and they are the only one not to confess   theyll get life  Now if you are prisoner confronted with this choice your best bet is to confess  If your partner doesnt confess youll get off completely  And if your partner does confess youd better confess to ensure you dont get life  The result is of course both prisoners confess so the sheriff does not have to let either one off  Both prisoners individual logic was to behave that way even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up  Dont worry if you dont entirely follow it   you can to look it up on Google where there are  entries on it     The prisoners dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades  It is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly     A cold war arms race for example   a classic case where both Russia and America would be better off with just a few arms rather than a lot of arms  But as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms results in arms levels that are too high  What economics tells us is that once youre in a prisoners dilemma   unless you are repeating the experience many times over   its hard to escape the perverse logic of it  Its no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on  Somehow the incentives have to change     In the case of the Labour Party if you believe the rift between Blair and Brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest Solomons wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem  Every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments solutions which affect the incentives of the participants  An example is the famous rule that  one divides the other chooses  as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children  In the case of an apparently endless argument if you want it to come to an end you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row  The cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing or one more book for that matter has to exceed the benefit of having the last word and getting your point in  If the rest of the party can enforce that theyll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly

Blair looks to election campaign    Tony Blairs big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign     That poll may still be about  weeks away but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing  The prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto  There was a detailed account of the governments past record with a major emphasis on the economy and public services  There was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with Chancellor Gordon Brown  And there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly  New  Labour   although that may continue to irritate his chancellor     There was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges although the prime minister talked about a  New Labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society   His was more a speech designed to remind people and some in his own party precisely what New Labour stood for and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach  And for some that means showing that New Labour actually does stand for something   that it is as he said more than  an electoral device      To that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle England voters who switched to the party in  and stuck with it possibly through some gritted teeth in  and to more traditional lower income old Labour supporters  In a key section he declared   In our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity   For the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability  Every family   not just the fortunate few   knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood   Every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship  Every adult   including those who missed out at school   able to get the skills then need to advance   Home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it   The highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions      Under what is to be the general election slogan  Britain is working  the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly New Labour  That might get under the skin of Mr Brown but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post war chancellor Britain has had  Probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men in so far as there is one is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services     An unremittingly  New  Labour manifesto as the prime minister is happy to make plain will stress the importance of that   the belief patients and parents for example want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them  The chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle  With an election looming the next big speech from Gordon Brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and in particular the use of that little three letter word  But for now all eyes have been focused on the next general election  And for many in Westminster Mr Blairs performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on  May

UKIPs secret weapon    By any measure New Yorker Dick Morris is that thing Americans love over everything else   a winner     This is the man who some pundits believe was almost single handedly responsible for Bill Clintons sensational  comeback victory  But Morris is no ideologue  He has worked as election strategist for any number of Republicans as well and more recently politicians from Mexico to Uruguay  Now he is back in London as the UK Independence Partys not so secret electoral weapon after returning from the Ukraine where he helped   you guessed it   opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko  If there is one regular criticism levelled at Morris it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances  That he enjoys the game more than the politics     So why Britain and why UKIP which despite its recent EU election successes is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election  On this subject Morris appears almost evangelical      I was on a cruise in the Mediterranean and coincidentally so was UKIP leader Roger Knapman   I had just written a piece saying how the English Channel was now wider than the Atlantic which he liked and it went from there   But what is it about UKIP that particularly attracts him Many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art irrespective of the politics   I think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism   A great soundbite but a surprise coming from a New Yorker post  September   It is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better who dont believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined   Thats international bankers the World Trade Organisation the International Monetary Fund the World Bank and primarily the European Union      So he is out to help UKIP take Britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic  And he is scathing of the Tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable   The Tory party is schizophrenic about Europe  But until somebody says they are willing to leave the EU they cant possibly re negotiate anything as Michael Howard is pledged to do   Its like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying  before I can proceed with the robbery I want to make clear I am not going to shoot anybody   Possibly a very American analogy but another great soundbite   The basic point is that the EU seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from Britain   and we oppose that and the Tories cannot be trusted to oppose it      So is UKIPs job to destroy the Tories as former member Robert Kilroy Silk once notoriously declared  No  The aim of UKIP is to withdraw from the EU and if it has any relation to the Tories it is to stiffen the Tories spine on the issue by having a large enough UKIP vote so that we move the Tories in the direction they are refusing to move      But its not just to shift the Tories  I think UKIP had a huge amount to do with Tony Blairs decision to hold a referendum on the European constitution and I think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro   And while we are on the subject of Mr Kilroy Silk Mr Morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites   Robert Kilroy Silk is not a team player   it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one      So what is the big plan for the general election  How will he achieve the breakthrough  Look we are not going to be forming the next government  he said  Neither does UKIP have to fight every seat  As with the  US presidential election he says the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats   just as he believes it will in Britain  So with limited resources the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the Commons  He also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll   The internet was a decisive factor in the  presidential election   through blogs individuals posting their views in online diaries  People just did it    Anything can happen in the next general election  There is an inherent instability at the moment   Labour and the Tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice      That might he suggests lead to a hung parliament with UKIP and others holding the balance of power  It is a huge task surely  But there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises   even while most still believe it is Labours for the taking  UKIPs performance in last years European elections was just such a shocker and showed that Mr Morris may have a point about the new consensus  And after all he has a reputation to sustain

Teens know little of politics    Teenagers questioned for a survey have shown little interest in politics   and have little knowledge     Only a quarter of   year olds knew that Labour was the government the Tories were the official Opposition and the Lib Dems were the third party  Almost all could identify Tony Blair but only one in six knew who Michael Howard was and just one in  recognised Charles Kennedy  The ICM survey interviewed  pupils for education watchdog Ofsted  Nearly half those pupils polled said it was not important for them to know more about what the political parties stand for  And   of those questioned thought the Conservatives were in power   while   of them believed the Lib Dems were  The survey also looked at issues of nationality  It found the Union flag and fish and chips topped the list of symbols and foods associated with being British  Many of the pupils also looked on themselves as English Scottish or Welsh rather than British  while the notion of being European hardly occurred to anyone

Defection timed to hit tax pledge    With impeccable and precisely calculated timing Tory defector Robert Jackson and his new Labour bosses have attempted to overshadow Michael Howards latest announcement on taxation and spending     With just about everyone in Westminster now working towards a May general election Mr Howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the Tories resolutely depressing poll showings  The big idea is his    savings on waste and bureaucracy which Mr Howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts  And it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the BBC Ones Breakfast with Frost programme  He and his shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now but without any concrete pledges  But Mr Howard announced that of the    he has earmarked from savings    will be used to plug Labours claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in Mr Letwins first budget  He would not be precise but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax  But he did for the first time say there would be such tax cuts      At this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and the Conservative party which will give value for money and tax less   It is the Tories attempt to open that famed  clear blue water  between them and the Labour party and return to a traditional Tory agenda that will both reassure the middle England voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core Conservative voters  So it is a pretty safe bet to assume that when Robert Jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the Labour benches his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact  Mr Howard however was dismissive   These things happen from time to time  There are disagreements between Robert Jackson and me      The election is not going to be decided on what Robert Jackson did  he added  And that is certainly true  The election will be decided on  the economy stupid   Other issues like the Iraq war and the  trust  thing will also play a major part  But it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote  And many on the Tory benches have been crying out for Mr Howard to get back onto the old Tory tax cuts agenda  Mr Howard knows that risks accusations that as a result he would slash public services so he has attempted to shoot that fox first  With polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts he has suggested that is exactly what he will do  Whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen

Tory leader unveils spending plan    Tory leader Michael Howard says his party can save    in government spending by tackling waste     The money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes  The Tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his MPs Robert Jackson a former minister to Labour  Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election   Lets be realistic   the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what Mr Jackson did  he told BBC  Breakfast with Frost programme  However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives spending plans  Fuller details are due to be unveiled on Monday     The bulk of the    saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services Mr Howard said  The    left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing he added  However the remainder would deal with some of the  unfair taxes    Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes  Mr Howard insisted   Because borrowing is going up it is out of control that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both   So part of the    we are going to apply to filling the governments black hole reducing the borrowing   The rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today      Mr Howard is expected to say that around    will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday  The cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble shooter David James  Home Office spending could be cut by     according to the final instalment of his year long review  Savings of    at the Foreign Office and    at the Department for Culture Media and Sport have also been identified  In all almost a quarter of a million jobs and  public bodies would go under Mr James proposals     Mr Howard said   All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less   However Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said   None of the Tories figures add up so they cant make these savings and cant pay for any tax cuts which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is    of cuts hitting frontline public services hard   Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added   People will not be taken in by Michael Howards claims of    worth of savings   This cant be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities   A poll for the News of the World newspaper suggests the Conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century  Labour will hold key marginal constituencies winning a majority of  the Populus survey suggests  And the Liberal Democrats will take three key seats from the Conservatives leaving the Tories with just  MPs two less than they returned atLabours  landslide and their worst showing since

Kennedy looks to election gains    They may not know quite how to describe their position in British politics   the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition     But the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected  election campaign determined to prove it is they not the Tories who are now the real threat to Labour  As Tory leader Michael Howard kicked off his election campaign the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy dismissed the Conservatives as a  fading  force  And he insisted there was  no limit  to his partys ambitions in the coming poll  And he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things  Sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test     And Mr Kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the partys Westminster HQ  He would make no predictions other than that he expected the Lib Dems to increase both their votes and their Commons seats at the election     The gap between Labour and the Tories was now so narrow   as proved he claimed by the defection to Labour of Robert Jackson   that only his party offered a genuine alternative  On the war on Iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the Liberal Democrats offered costed sensible alternatives  He was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than    a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax  He was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to  prop up  either of the other big parties after the election     There was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self delusion  That is no longer the case with the Liberal Democrats  The other parties will still insist that the Lib Dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats     Labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the Lib Dems allowing the Tories to win some seats  But Mr Kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that  He will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold  They would argue that by the time of the election after next the Liberal Democrats may genuinely have replaced the Tories as the party challenging Labour for power  The Lib Dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on Iraq  But Mr Kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name

Best person for top legal job    The  best person for the job  should be appointed lord chancellor and not necessarily a lawyer or MP the courts minister has told MPs     Under reforms the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions   The lord chancellor   no more needs to be a lawyer than the Secretary of Health needs to be a doctor  said courts minister Christopher Leslie  The Constitutional Reform Bill was entering its second reading on Monday  Mr Leslie said   The prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the House of Lords or the House of Commons   Under the reforms the Law Lords will also be replaced as the UKs highest legal authority by a Supreme Court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers     In December the Lords rejected a plea by current Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer  The peers voted by  to  to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers  The debate was carried over from the last Parliamentary session but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the Bill passed  Mr Leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs or Lord Chancellor  He said   What matters most is   whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties   It is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges      Shadow attorney general Dominic Grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an  exceptional institution  providing a  champion of the independence of the judiciary   The government had initially proposed to take this institution and  smash it to pieces  Mr Grieve said  Convention should be  nurtured and celebrated  but the government distrusted and disliked it instead  He warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the House of Lords the government would have  great difficulty  in getting the Bill through Parliament  Former Cabinet minister Douglas Hogg whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor said the Bill was  largely unnecessary bureaucratic and expensive   But the Tory MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham admitted the lord chancellors role and office  cannot be frozen in aspic
