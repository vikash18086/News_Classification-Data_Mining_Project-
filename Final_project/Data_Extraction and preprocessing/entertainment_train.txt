Redfords vision of Sundance    Despite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses Robert Redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star struck crowds at Sundance     Its a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in Park City Utah back in the   Now in its twenty first year Sundance continues to grow  Some  people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind  Its an opportunity to meet and make deals  Redford wanted Sundance to be a platform for independent film makers but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream     Smaller festivals like Slamdance and XDance which take place during the same week in Park City are competing for Sundances limelight  But Redford is not worried   The more the merrier  he says   The point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them   Once independent film had a place where the work could be seen suddenly the merchants came  With them the celebrities came then the paparazzi   and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone  explains Redford      People started to say we had gone mainstream and Hollywood but actually Hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film  he adds  International film makers have always been celebrated here but  is the first year a dedicated World Dramatic and Documentary competition is being held     Redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the American media fails to reflect particularly how the US is perceived internationally  He has never hidden the fact that he is a Democrat  But he reserves particular disdain for the current Republican administration   Its the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration  he says   I think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view  Thats very unhealthy and very dangerous      If we take that policy into the world there will be the same victims and the same consequences   Sundance isnt just one big screening  There are discussion panels and Q A sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like Americas  culture wars  and the Iraq war  While Redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic  Educated middle class and predominantly white Americans comes Sundance with views from the same end of the political spectrum   anti war and socially liberal  But Redford knows this and started the Sundance TV Channel in an effort to reach a wider audience   When you look at the films here what we are presenting is very much egalitarian  And its about good films and good story telling be it African America Asian women gay lesbian   Sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say its just a film by so and so

DVD review  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban    This third Harry Potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shake up that really shines on DVD     Gone are the warm bright colours found in the two earlier films Alfonso Cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous   and looks even better here than in the cinema  It is all part of the progression of Harrys story into darker areas but youll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful Hogwarts landscape     This is the first Potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book  It is the third year at Hogwarts and studies are interrupted as they always are by a calamity that only Harry Ron and Hermione can put right     It sounds corny  But Harry is no longer the winsome hero he is a moody teenager and Daniel Radcliffe pulls it off very well  Emma Watson is ever better as Hermione and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson  The film itself is the reason to buy this DVD  But it is laden with behind the scenes extras including funny if shallow interviews with all the main cast  But what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch  Younger viewers will go for the games which include a Magic You May Have Missed memory test and Crookshanks chasing off after Scabbers  Adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes  You will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage   and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it as we did on the first Harry Potter DVD  The most interesting pieces are an interview with JK Rowling in Creating The Vision and Conjuring A Scene a short featurette about the making of the films big moments

DVD review  Spider Man     Its a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good  But Spider Man  breaks that rule in two     Its not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of Spidey versus Doc Ock and more so into the fate of poor Peter Parker  Gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning  A few effects look false but Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina make this compelling  The other universal rule is that DVDs of superhero films will have Making Of features only about the effects  This disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film  Then there are commentaries trailers and a blooper reel     Sometimes quality comes in bulk  this set contains no less than  John Wayne films ranging from the Westerns and war movies to The Quiet Man     Now is that a Christmas present or what Give this to someone on  December and you wont see them again until early in the New Year  Its not truly a complete collection and leans more toward Waynes earlier films  theres no True Grit for instance though there is Hellraisers  The films look well transferred to DVD though none has extras     It was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous  series became a cult favourite thats been long awaited on DVD  This set has the first season of Buck Gil Gerard and Wilmas Erin Gray tongue in cheek adventures and its all as camp and gaudy as you remember  But its also a disappointment  The US DVD has this and the more po faced second season   and you can import it for just about the same price  The bigger omission though is that there are no extras  Thats particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars Gerard and Gray had agreed to do them

My memories of Marley       To mark the  anniversary of the birth of reggae star Bob Marley Rob Partridge   Marleys former head of press at Island Records   remembers the man behind the legend     Partridge worked with Marley from  until the Jamaican musicians death in         I joined Island Records in  and the first week I was there I worked on his show at the Rainbow Theatre  It was one of the last dates he did in London        The album Exodus came out in  and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status   By  he was the biggest touring attraction in the world  I remember going to see dates in Milan and Turin and they were enormous concerts        Bob was one of the most mesmeric people Ive ever had the privilege to work with   He must have had an iron will to succeed  Bob was a very driven individual  You realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in  He didnt suffer fools gladly  At the risk of stating the obvious he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest Ive ever seen  I saw him many times         I recall in  he came to the UK for Top of the Pops and a Daily Mirror journalist did a half hour interview  It was interrupted to do a rehearsal  He came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a World Cup match on TV      He sat down in front of the TV and after  minutes it was obvious he wasnt going to move  That was the end of it  The Mirror had a very truncated interview   The last time I saw him was in London in   I arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in Fulham   Bob was a good player  We are talking about Jamaican style football  He was an attacking midfield player  His team assembled wherever his gigs were  We played in Brazil against some World Cup winning players        It was always a struggle for him to connect with Black America  Reggae did not correspond with disco in the   But Bob in the  became one of the great icons in America and the Third World   In  ten years after his death he sold more records than at any time during his life   We saw Black America taking Bob into their hearts for the first time         Bob in worldwide terms is the greatest music star there has ever been  If you went to Africa he would be recognised everywhere in places John Lennon or Elvis wouldnt be   No disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest the best and the most influential artist in popular music        Well  was to be the year he toured Africa with Stevie Wonder  He had only performed in Zimbabwe and Guinea before   Of course the  tour never happened but the whole of Africa would have embraced him  We cant speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just  years old  I had no sense his career was going to go downhill         Bob was endlessly optimistic about the way Africa would turn out  He realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind   Im sure if he were alive today he would believe Africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the Aids epidemic         The final tune of his final album was Redemption Song   one of the most incredible classics of all time

Franz man seeks government help    Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an Edinburgh Lectures discussion      For any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well  he said  But Kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with MPs at the University of Edinburgh event   I think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them  he said     Kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss Scotlands role in making  Century music   There are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they arent self sufficient  he said   But so called commercial music would benefit from investment as well   He warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however   I dont know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea      Kapranos and his Glasgow four piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next weeks Brit Awards including best group and best album  Their self titled debut album won last years Mercury Music Prize and spawned three top  singles  He told the  strong audience at the Universitys Reid Hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes   We say I like this  Because I listen to Nirvana and Korn I am a troubled individual Im riddled with angst because I listen to Chopin and Debussy I listen to Kylie Minogue and Scissor Sisters because Im upbeat and I like to party I listen to Wagner because I like the smell of napalm in the morning   Kapranos said there was a general  hostility  towards classical music adding   There is very little done to break that hostility other than Classic FM      He concluded   We define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity   Fellow speaker and classical composer James MacMillan agreed   We need to rediscover our ability to listen   Previous speakers at the Edinburgh Lectures series have included former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and author Professor Stephen Hawking  Kapranos described his appearance on Wednesday as  more daunting by a long way  than their upcoming Brits performance   I dont really care about the Brits  he said   Its going to be great to go down but I have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight      I think the government should do more to help up and coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues  Also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels     Rather than expecting the government   i e  the taxpayer   to fork out why dont some of the megastars put something back in Some of Britains wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc  There are far more important demands on government funds     If they can fund football why not fund music    Areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music  The only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash     The government has enough problems funding schools and health services  If Alex Kapranos genuinely thinks a multi billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that     As a Scot living in England I appreciate the value of Scottish music and culture being a success so I can see no problem with it! Franz Ferdinand Travis and Snow Patrol are just recent examples of the success Scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we Scots are good at and support our own goods!    I think the issue is more fundamental  should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state The answer is most definitely no  Those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldnt be looking for government subsidies  I know that if I was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping I would want to finance myself until I was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship     Yes the government should fund music   it brings joy to the masses     There are already thousands of state funded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the  new deal   Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use     As long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move  I would hate to see more Pop Idol type funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about     Only if the proposals make financial sense  Franz Ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales   if theyd had a government grant to get started theyd have more than paid it back by now so the Treasury would be making far more than it paid out  However the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre a musician  The government shouldnt  fund  music   it should  invest  in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment     I think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise  The equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people  However I do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there     I do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! They generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for! If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out a great deal     Yeah why not Music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands artists and stuff  Pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternities    I agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer  There is a great deal of money generated through pop music   perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy  Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol style music   that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers  Call it a tax on music  pollution  if you like     Though I really like Franz Ferdinand I have to disagree with Mr Kapranos  Once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues  Many years ago this was the case with the US NEA when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting  The solution Mr Kapranos should pursue would be privately funded organizations like Save the Music in the US

CSI shows give unrealistic view    People have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the CSI TV shows real experts say     Evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes at a time when many have large backlogs science investigators claim  Lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used  The issue was discussed at a major science conference in Washington DC  Crime Scene Investigation CSI and its spin offs CSI  Miami and CSI  New York have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the Atlantic     Each episode a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science   and the extensive resources at their disposal   The CSI effect is basically the perception of the near infallibility of forensic science in response to the TV show  said Max Houck who runs a forensic science graduate course at West Virginia University US   This TV show comes on and everyone starts watching it   including the cops and prosecutors   and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof  he told the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS  The American forensics expert said there were roughly   backlogged DNA samples in US labs  Yet these constituted just   of the total test backlog said Dr Houck  Forensic pathologist Dr Patricia McFeeley said she had started to see the shows influence in dealing with the families of victims   What I find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case  she explained   For example on television the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously  But when people find out that it can take several months they can find that very difficult      Dr McFeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most peoples perceptions  The shows influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom making lawyers jittery   Prosecutors fear the CSI effect with juries because for example they wonder  why wasnt everything tested Well in fact not everything needs to be tested  Dr Houck explained   Defence attorneys also worry about the CSI effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut  this objective method thats always accurate   However he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field   My university course started with four graduates in   were now the largest major on campus   with  students  he said  Dr Houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level   Theres more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research
