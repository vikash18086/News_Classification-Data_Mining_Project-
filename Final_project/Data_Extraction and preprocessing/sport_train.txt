  An Irish Athletics Year     wont be remembered as one of Irish athletics great years     The year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably seems to herald an upcoming Olympiad  But come late August a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics   or to be more accurate the lack of it  Sonia OSullivans Olympic farewell apart there was little to stir the emotions of Irish athletics watchers  But after the disastrous build up to the games we shouldnt have been surprised  At the start of the year an OSullivan had been earmarked as Irelands best medal prospect but as it turned out walker Gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury  Less than a week before the Olympics the sport was rocked by news that  hope Cathal Lombard had tested for the banned substance EPO  Lombards shattering of Mark Carrolls national  record in April had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers were surprised when he was rumbled after an Irish Sports Council sting operation  The Corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two year ban from the sport     Back at pre Olympic ranch in Greece it must have seemed that things couldnt have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker Jamie Costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near Athens  Once the track and field action began in Athens a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Craggs performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the  final did offer hope for the future  Our beloved Sonia scraped into the womens  final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake up  As it happened she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar  It later transpired that Sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the  hours before the final although typically the Cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness  Amazingly she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world class field at the Flora Lite  road race in London and while her major championship days may be over its unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition  At least Sonia managed to make it to Athens  At the start of the year several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the Games but come August an out of form and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province  The Ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem and a bad lane draw meant a time of   and an early exit     James McIlroy Gareth Turnbull Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens   hope McIlroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane  The injury plagued Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the  qualifying mark but   was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter  A lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked McKees Athens ambitions and both he and Turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in   Pole vaulter Brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the British selectors after she had achieved the Athens B standard but the call never came  As the summer ended stalwarts Catherina McKiernan and Dermot Donnelly hung up their competitive spikes  McKiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury ravaged years  Donnelly and his Annadale Striders team mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman Andy Campbell was found dead at his home on  December  A large turnout of athletics loving folk turned out in west Belfast to offer their respects to the Campbell family and Andys many friends  As only death can it put the years athletics happenings in a sharp perspective

Athens memories soar above lows    Well its goodbye to another Olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in Athens     Obviously theres no getting away from the differing fortunes of Kelly Holmes and Paula Radcliffe  But I want to remind you of a few more events that made  another year to remember   or forget   for athletics           One of my favourite Olympic moments was Kellys success in the      Winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the  would be a bit of a formality  Kelly had been full of  should I shouldnt I  thoughts about going for the double in Athens  I thought why wouldnt you do the  its your best event It was such good fun to commentate on her  and it was nice to be able to be part of her Athens story           The victory for the British mens  relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the Games  I think the four of them   Jason Gardener Darren Campbell Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis Francis   knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal  The lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake           Hicham El Guerroujs Olympic double is a much bigger achievement than Kellys on a global scale     He was the first man since for  years to win both the  and  titles  As soon as he had added the  crown and I had finished commentating I jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug  He is one of the few African runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the Roger Bannister stories  Hicham is someone I enjoy having a bit of time with even though my French and his English are not very good           What happened to Paula in Athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well  There were a set of circumstances around Athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which I think has been greatly misunderstood  Dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the  five days later was not wise  That was her heart and not her head reacting  Paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day     Things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her  I think she came to the start line in Athens physically and emotionally drained  And if even the smallest thing doesnt feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon  miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall  The positive thing to take from Paulas Olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people   including me           Purely as a race Paulas victory in the New York Marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling  It was so nip and tuck between her and Kenyas Susan Chepkemei and you dont usually get that kind of excitement in marathons  It was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words Paula showed real  bouncebackability   And it was a bit of a rarity for me too because I genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out           Kelly and the  boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the British team  We should be concerned that were not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level     The only individual mens finalist on the track was Michael East in the   I am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed And thats where things begin to look even gloomier for British athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in Italy  Dani Barnes came fourth in the  and she was the highest finisher for Team GB  The thing is if we dont have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesnt look good for the Beijing Olympics and beyond           I tell you what I really enjoyed this year Benita Johnson winning the world cross country championships back in March  In the absence of Paula we tend to think of the event as something of an African preserve  So to have an Australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special           To be honest Im getting bored with all the drug scandals especially Balco  I just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on     Having said that Im always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore  And one of the positive things to come out of Balco is people are starting to blow the whistle  We need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats  As regards the case against Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou well suspicions have been hanging over Kenteris for a while  The bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it

Radcliffe proves doubters wrong    This wont go down as one of the greatest marathons of Paulas career  But as a test of character it was the toughest race shes ever taken part in     A win in the New York marathon doesnt make up for the disappointment of Athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year  If Paulas last experience of the year had been Athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism  She can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future  Even if shed lost this race there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it  She knows she can dig deep if she needs to  It was a strong field with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning  And although two hours  minutes wasnt one of Paulas best times it wasnt far off the record on a difficult course     I was speaking to Paula in the lead up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no win situation  She thought that if she won people would say  why couldnt she do that in Athens  And if she lost people would say her career was over  And a lot of people were wondering what would happen if Paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and  in Athens  But that was never on the cards  She might have been beaten but she would have kept running  The reasons she was forced to pull out in Athens   the niggling injuries her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions   werent at play here  The only question was what position she could finish in  Most important of all despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race there were never doubts in Paulas mind  If she wasnt confident she wouldnt have run  After all if youre the best in the world at an event youll always have expectations of winning     Now Paula will take part in the Run London  race in London at the end of the year have a well earned rest over Christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism

Radcliffe tackles marathon tasks    Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday     Back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics where she failed to finish the marathon and then the   BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race      The ability to run a gruelling   miles relies largely upon an athletes belief that they can do it  Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it  Are you strong enough to finish     The question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high profile and emotional circumstances  Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the  year old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence   There is an old adage get straight back on the horse that threw you  Richards told BBC Sport   Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens   She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running   If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness   She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment       For much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York   win or lose  If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong  But if she fails to triumph she risks being labelled a has been and her profile will suffer  And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues      Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions  explains Richards who has worked with past Olympians   She must not get caught up in someone elses agenda   Radcliffes best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the  year old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York   She just thought well they cant think any worse of me now  Yelling told BBC Sport   Shes just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it       Radcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as  impulsive  but she is certain to have a tick list of personal goals  Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets such as redemption   You cant change history  warned Richards   Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful   Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race       The course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world  It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs final reserves     Radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just  days after the Athens marathon   Its suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again  said Yelling herself a marathon runner   But that is only for long term health and fitness   When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly  So physically it is possible for Paula   Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe   The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens  he said   And that just isnt going to be there in New York thats been taken out of the equation           Radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time  And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage starting in New York   How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not  argues Richards      One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities   And Yelling says   I think this will probably make Paula    I think it will drive her on and shell come out of it a better athlete

What now for Kelly Holmes    Last April Kelly Holmes spoke to the BBC Sport website about her loneliness her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the  and  at the Olympics     It just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them  Four months later Holmes stormed to double Olympic gold and has since been made a Dame won the BBC Sport Personality of the Year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes  With so much time spent in the spotlight Holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt  And when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead the  year old has repeatedly chosen to tick the  dont know  box  Holmes has now pulled out of this weekends European Indoor Championships where she was selected for both the  and  because of a hamstring injury  But should we be surprised if the Olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore  Well its a lot easier being the double Olympic champion being feted by everybody than training to be at the top in middle distance running  points out former Olympian and BBC pundit Steve Cram   You have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if youre very talented      Holmes drive and determination have always been unquestionable   that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty handed  But alarm bells start ringing when the Kent athlete begins questioning herself   Will I have as much commitment desire and energy to go through a major championship  Holmes asked in the New Year   That is what I dont know   At  Holmes will also be aware that time is running out  US  and  legend Michael Johnson a five time Olympic gold medallist retired shortly after his  birthday as did Britains double Olympic champion decathlete Daley Thompson  The physical demands of the day to day grind will only get harder for Holmes who has already admitted she  doesnt like the training anymore   Whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double Olympic champion will spur her opponents on  Holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten  Unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race she will not step onto the track  But if the Kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer there are more prizes up for grabs  The day after completing her double in Athens the  year old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title     Holmes wish could easily be met in Madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled such as a first gold at the World Championships in Helsinki  There is just one small truth which could gnaw away at Holmes motivation   the realisation that no matter how hard she trains nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in Athens  On the other hand if those achievements cannot be matched shouldnt they be at least shared and celebrated  You dont get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double Olympic champion  agreed Cram   You want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because its a fantastic feeling   I think deep down Kelly wants to run  I think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain      Athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new look Kelly Holmes tearing up the track again  After her Olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire  So why is Holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where when or whether to even bother competing again  Thats just Kelly  explains Cram   Shes always been like that   She enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next  She knows every time she makes a pronouncement now its headline news   Kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions whether she can be competitive if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line   And if she decides not to run again no one is going to turn round and say youre making the wrong decision

European medal chances improve    What have the European Indoor trials told us Well I think we could be heading to the European Championships with half a dozen medal prospects     It was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around     The best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxtons win in the  hurdles  Running sub eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal  But what was great about Sundays performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted  Diane Allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and I think she was surprised to be beaten by Sarah  And knowing that she got the better of Diane in a head to head race will give Sarah confidence  In the mens race on Saturday Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him  In fact the mens  hurdles is so strong I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid     Phillips Idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of   which puts him at the top of the world rankings  I had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there  He feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him   but then Phillips always has  A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for Phillips to jump like that is a good performance  He is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency   and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further  Across the board I thought Kelly Sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing  She picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and  hurdles and you cant ask for more than that  Kelly will be up against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon at the European Championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what weve seen so far     She has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well  It wasnt all good news in Sheffield  I thought both the  races were disappointing in different ways  Jason Gardener may have won but he wasnt at his best  I chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off day for him  Hes there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there  In the womens race Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka  The pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but Joice had to pull out with a chest infection  If she had made the final I think Jeanette would have gone a bit quicker     Janine Whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two year drugs ban  But the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldnt be the case  The event has moved on immensely since Janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think that would help her  A couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding Mark Findlay and Rabah Yusuf  Findlay is a Londoner who has chosen to represent Trinidad and Tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for Great Britain  Yusuf who came third in the  is from the Sudan but is trying to gain British citizenship  He came to Britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent  So we shall have to see what happens to both of them

Holmes back on form in Birmingham    Double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes was back to her best as she comfortably won the  at the Norwich Union Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix     The  year old running only her second competitive race of the season shook off the rust to win in two minutes   seconds  But she is still undecided about competing in the European Championships in Madrid from   March   Ill probably be entered and make my mind up at the last minute  she said   My training hasnt gone as well as expected but Ive got two weeks to decide   I need to take my time and make sure I feel good about what Im doing   I felt very good here but with the crowd behind you you feel like you can do anything   American    was the eventual winner of the mens  race which almost ended in farce  Three athletes were disqualified for false starting including Britains Mark Lewis Francis who was the first man guilty of coming out of his blocks too quickly  World  champion Kim Collins clinched second spot ahead of world  record holder and Scotts training partner Maurice Greene  Jason Gardeners unbeaten run came to an end as he came fifth and he will need to improve if he is to defend his European title in Madrid   You cant win them all  said Gardener afterwards   And I was very disappointed as I know Im capable of doing better   Russian    was back on record breaking form in the pole vault at the National Indoor Arena     The Olympic champion set a new world mark of   to break her own record   which she set just six days ago   and beat Russian rival Svetlana Feofanova  It was Isinbayevas  world record   indoors or out   since July    Im so happy and I will do my best to break the  barrier soon  the  year old told BBC Sport  Jamaicas    stormed to a personal best of   seconds to claim the womens  sprint  Belgian Kim Gevaert who will be one of the favourites for next months European title took second while American Muna Lee was third  There was disappointment for British pair Jeanette Kwakye and Joice Maduaka who finished seventh and eighth respectively     Jamaican    stretched her unbeaten record to  races as she effortlessly claimed the   The Olympic champion set a new indoor personal best of   seconds   the fastest time in the world this season     fought off fellow Briton Tim Abeyie to take the mens  in a personal best of       continued her outstanding start to the season beating a strong international field which included two time Olympic  hurdles bronze medallist Melissa Morrison to claim the womens  hurdles  The  year old Briton clocked   seconds while pre European Championships favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko finished down in sixth  Ethiopias    failed in her bid to smash compatriot Berhane Aderes world  record but still won the event in emphatic style  The Olympic  champion was inside record pace but dropped off over the final third finishing in eight minutes   seconds   the fourth fastest time ever recorded for the event  Britains Jo Pavey bravely decided to go with Defar as she strode away from the field and took second in a seasons best     Kenyan    also missed out on the indoor  world record which Hicham El Guerrouj has held for the last eight years     Lagat settled for silver behind El Guerrouj in Athens and was almost four seconds short of the Moroccans world best clocking    in Birmingham  And    was still struggling to find his form after the death of his fiancee this year  The Olympic  champion had comfortably led the mens two mile race after his younger brother Tariku had set the pace  But fellow Ethiopian    appeared ominously on Bekeles shoulder with two laps to go before surging past him at the bell to win in     Jamaican    made the most of a blistering start to take the mens  title in   seconds  World indoor champion Alleyne Francique faded badly and finished in fourth while American duo Jerry Harris and James Davis took second and third respectively  Swede    showed her class in the long jump as she stole top spot from Jade Johnson with the very last jump of the competition  The Olympic heptathlon gold medallist reached   to better Johnsons mark of     her second personal best inside a week   I was quite surprised because I didnt think Id end up with second place  said Johnson who wore Londons  Olympic bid slogan  Back the Bid  on her shorts   But Im pleased and hopefully Ill get a bit better for the Europeans  I really want to win a medal      won the mens event with a seasons best of   taking the scalp of world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow of the USA

Record fails to lift lacklustre meet    Yelena Isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in Birmingham     And hey there are not many meets that go by without the Russian breaking a world record     Apparently Isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and I would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time  Athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and I would like to see her have a go at  in competition  Mind you every time she breaks the record she gets   so she can afford to be deliberate about it  World records aside I thought it was a very encouraging evenings work for Kelly Holmes  She looked good and was very positive  Agnes Samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the worlds top three  runners this season  Yes Samaria let Kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last  as Kelly dominated the race so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly  My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships but she just hasnt convinced herself she is fit enough to do so  On the other hand I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the mens  in Madrid  He started well in the final but still could not stay with the front runners  Jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish     It would have been nice to see what Mark Lewis Francis could have done in the final if only he hadnt got himself disqualified  He was blatantly playing the false start game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly  My view is youre meant to go when the gun goes and not before  And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again  Having said that Mark is looking in much better shape  But I havent seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests Frances Ronald Pognon   who has run   seconds   will be under threat at the Europeans  From a British point of view Sarah Claxtons victory in the  hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet     Something else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the womens national  race in a new personal best of   seconds  AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong  squad going to the European Championships  Scotlands Lee McConnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal  From an international perspective I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the  but I dont think the pace making was great  Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last years shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money  She had a go but just could not hang in there  We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the mens   But he has only just come over from the USA so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape  As for Kenenisa Bekele he was well beaten by Markos Geneti  But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season  It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box  I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly

Running around the Olympics    It was back to official duties last week in my role as an ambassador to Londons  Olympic bid  But I still managed to do all my marathon training     All the sporting people on the capitals bid team think Im mad to be taking part in the London Marathon  The bid chairman Lord Coe admitted he would never dream of running a marathon even though he was an Olympic middle distance runner     Kelly Holmes former hurdler Alan Pascoe and former sprinter Frankie Fredericks   who is now an IOC member   all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far  Youd have thought all these athletes who have been running for most of their lives wouldnt think it would be that bad  But the only person who was positive about my intentions was Tanni Grey Thompson who has won the London Marathon wheelchair race six times  Even though it was a very busy week entertaining the International Olympic Committees IOC Evaluation Commission I actually found my running schedule easier to follow  When Im at home I get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days I was in London I was in a pressurised situation but I found it easy to relax by running     On Wednesday the presentations to the IOC team did not finish until the early evening so I just managed to squeeze in a  minute run  We had an early start on Thursday because we had to visit all the Olympic sites around London that was pretty shattering but when we got back to the hotel I got back on the treadmill  On Friday evening I went along to the special dinner at Buckingham Palace which was a nice occasion  I never feel guilty about eating especially when Im exercising  And because it was a rest day I didnt have to feel bad about missing my training either  Anyway I managed to do another quick run on Saturday ahead of the final IOC presentations before heading home for my daughters birthday     When I was in London I did all of my runs on the treadmill which isnt the same as exercising outdoors  One of the IOCs technical staff from Australia ran alongside me one day  We talked about the Sydney Olympics and that made the time go past more quickly  I do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning  But when youre gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement  It was good to get out on the road for my long run on Sunday  After the week Id had I was a bit concerned I wouldnt be able to complete it  But I coped with it very well and even though it was bitterly cold I put in  and a half miles   only another  to go then       This year Steve will donate all the proceeds from his London Marathon efforts to victims of the tsunami Steve will be writing a regular column on the ups and downs of his marathon training for the BBC Sport website He will be raising money through the Steve Redgrave Trust which supports the Association of Childrens Hospices the Children With Leukaemia charity and the Trusts own project which aims to provide inner city schools with rowing equipment

Costin aims for comeback in     Jamie Costin should be paralysed     He says so himself in a matter of fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the  Walk  There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry driving on the wrong side of the road had ploughed into his rental car   I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken  says the Waterford man   But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know   In my back it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully Id be able to race   It took over  hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics   My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae the bottom part had exploded so Im fierce lucky not be paralysed   Id fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake   Jamie didnt finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident      For the first nine hours I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in  degrees heat   But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking OK Ive got a different set of circumstances now   Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance  Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamies back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home   something he is now very relieved about   The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae   That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again  They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery   But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me  The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic   Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back     He then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on  January   Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery   Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery   Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and its very effective   Needles get put right close up to my spine  A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and Im fairly incapacitated today as a result   Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years   I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy   Basically theres a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus  degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing      Jamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice daily physio sessions and pool work  All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in    Its all about trying to get mobility in my back  Lying down for three and a half months didnt really help with the strength   Theres a lot of work involved in my recovery  Im doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work   Im also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles  Im fairly full on with everything I do   Id hope to be training regularly by March  But training is just part of the process of getting back   At the moment every time I go and do a big bit of movement my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up   Its a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts  Hopefully after four or five months my back wont tighten up as much

Man Utd stroll to Cup win    Wayne Rooney made a winning return to Everton as Manchester United cruised into the FA Cup quarter finals     Rooney received a hostile reception but goals in each half from Quinton Fortune and Cristiano Ronaldo silenced the jeers at Goodison Park  Fortune headed home after  minutes before Ronaldo scored when Nigel Martyn parried Paul Scholes free kick  Marcus Bent missed Evertons best chance when Roy Carroll who was later struck by a missile saved at his feet     Rooneys return was always going to be a potential flashpoint and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick off  And Rooneys every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the  year old  Everton started brightly and Fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from Bent near the goal line  But that was the cue for United to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a Goodison Park pitch that was cutting up  Fortune gave United the lead after  minutes rising to meet Ronaldos cross from eight yards after the Portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless Gary Naysmith  United dominated without creating too many clear cut chances and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half time  Mikel Arteta played a superb ball into the area but Bent played onside by Gabriel Heintze hesitated and Carroll plunged at his fee to save  United almost doubled their lead after  minutes when Ronaldos low drive from  yards took a deflection off Tony Hibbert but Martyn dived to save brilliantly  And Martyn came to Evertons rescue three minutes later when Rooneys big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form  But there was nothing Martyn could do when United doubled their lead after  minutes as they doubled their advantage  Scholes free kick took a deflection and Martyn could only parry the ball out for Ronaldo who reacted first to score easily  Evertons problems worsened when James McFadden limped off with an injury  And there may be further trouble ahead for Everton after goalkeeper Carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal  Rooneys desperate search for a goal on his return to Everton was halted again by Martyn in injury time when he outpaced Stubbs but once again Martyn denied the England striker       Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson   It was a fantastic performance by us  In fairness I think Everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out   The boy Ronaldo is a fantastic player  Hes persistent and never gives in   I dont know how many fouls he had He gets up and wants the ball again hes truly a fabulous player   Everton  Martyn Hibbert Yobo Stubbs Naysmith Osman Carsley Arteta Kilbane McFadden Bent  Subs  Wright Pistone Weir Plessis Vaughan  Manchester United  Carroll Gary Neville Brown Ferdinand Heinze Ronaldo Phil Neville Keane Scholes Fortune Rooney  Subs  Howard Giggs Smith Miller Spector  Referee  R Styles Hampshire

Man City   Man Utd    Manchester United reduced Chelseas Premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over Manchester City     Wayne Rooney met Gary Nevilles cross to the near post with a low shot which went in via a deflection off Richard Dunne to put United ahead  Seven minutes later the unfortunate Dunne hooked a volley over David James head and into his own net  Steve McManaman wasted Citys best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half  In the opening  minutes United had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching Chelsea in the title race  Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance   a Paul Scholes header over the bar  And City seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern  Only Shaun Wright Phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony looking lively down the right and causing Gabriel Heinze problems     Wes Brown also found Wright Phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline  Wright Phillips sublime skill and pace took him past Brown and he delivered a pin point centre to the feet of McManaman  But the former Liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against United by side footing the easy chance wide  John OShea was forced off after an earlier clash with Sylvain Distin and Cristiano Ronaldo came on to replace him  He immediately caused Ben Thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much needed pace into the United attack  Rooney was being well marshalled by Dunne   but that was all about to change  After the break United poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play  And when Neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of Citys best first half chance Rooney showed McManaman how to do it   even if he needed the help of Dunnes leg  Worse was to come for Dunne who had been having a fine match  On  minutes he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear Rooneys cross and United seemed home and dry  However City did fight back and Fowler missed another great chance from close range  And United keeper Roy Carroll saved well from Kiki Musampa  But United could have a had a third late on when substitute Ryan Giggs hit the post       Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan   We had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial   We started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much   But we still had four good chances two after wed gone   down the one McManaman missed was very similar to the one Wayne Rooney scored from        Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson   It wasnt our best performance of the last three months but I think were deserved winners   At times especially in the first half we didnt play with enough speed  But with Cristiano Ronaldo and Ryan Giggs on the speed improved   Derby games can be like that they can be scrappy dull horrible and it was maybe like that   Man City  James Mills Bradley Wright Phillips  Dunne Distin Thatcher Shaun Wright Phillips Barton Macken  Sibierski McManaman Musampa Fowler  Subs Not Used  Weaver Onuoha Flood  Booked  Fowler Sibierski  Man Utd  Carroll Gary Neville Ferdinand Brown Heinze OShea Ronaldo  Keane Fortune Fletcher Giggs  Rooney Scholes Phil Neville   Subs Not Used  Howard Bellion  Booked  Rooney Scholes Keane  Goals  Rooney  Dunne  og  Att   Ref  S Bennett Kent

Chelsea clinch cup in extra time    after extra time   score at  mins      John Arne Riise volleyed Liverpool ahead after  seconds but Steven Gerrard scored a  minute own goal  Blues boss Jose Mourinho was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game  Drogba and Kezman scored from close range before Antonio Nunezs header made for a tense finale  It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager  Yet it was controversial too after Mourinhos sending off apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans  There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute     Riise could not have connected any better with Morientes cross as he smashed a left foot volley past Petr Cech  The goal the quickest ever in a League Cup final stunned a Blues side whose previously rock solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week  The Blues attacking chances were limited and Jerzy Dudek was equal to Frank Lampards powerfully struck drive and Drogbas low shot  Despite their frustration Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpools well organised defence     Joe Cole had a shot blocked and a promising Damien Duff break was halted by a good tackle from Djimi Traore but the Reds reached half time without any major scares  The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back  Nevertheless Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from Dudek on  minutes first at full stretch from Gudjohnsens header then to smother William Gallas follow up  And despite Chelseas possession it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as Luis Garcia fed Dietmar Hamann whose shot forced a superb save from Cech  And the Blues increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on  minutes as Paulo Ferreira denied Gerrard with a last ditch tackle  But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later   in the most unfortunate fashion   as he inadvertently deflected Ferreriras free kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level  That prompted Mourinhos reaction which saw him sent off but Chelsea still pressed and Duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining  Dudek saved bravely at the Irishmans feet while Milan Baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time  Drogba almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post  But seconds after the half time interval Drogba made no mistake picking the ball up from Glen Johnsons long throw inside the six yard box and sidefooting home  And Kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after Gudjohnsens cross in the  minute  There was still drama as Nunez beat Cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level but despite Liverpools desperate attacks Chelsea clung on to win     Dudek Finnan Carragher Hyypia Traore Biscan  Luis Garcia Gerrard Hamann Riise Kewell Nunez  Morientes Baros      Subs Not Used  Pellegrino Carson     Hyypia Traore Hamann Carragher     Riise  Nunez      Cech Paulo Ferreira Ricardo Carvalho Terry Gallas Kezman  Jarosik Gudjohnsen  Lampard Makelele Cole Johnson  Drogba Duff     Subs Not Used  Pidgeley Tiago     Lampard Kezman Drogba Duff     Gerrard  og Drogba  Kezman          S Bennett Kent

Newcastle   Bolton    Kieron Dyer smashed home the winner to end Boltons  game unbeaten run     Lee Bowyer put Newcastle ahead when he fed Stephen Carr on the right flank then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross  Wanderers hit back through Stelios Giannakopoulos who ended a fluid passing move with a well struck volley  But Dyer had the last word in a game of few chances pouncing on a loose ball after Alan Shearers shot was blocked and firing into the top corner  Neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game with plenty of tackles flying in but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by  Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first half   keeping out Shearers low shot and Dyers close range header   but that was the only goalmouth action of note  And it was almost out of nothing that the Magpies took the lead on  minutes  Bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half way line and striding forward picked out Carr to his right  He then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met Carrs cross with a downward header into the far corner  Bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well     They were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from Giannakopoulos  Jay Jay Okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving Kevin Davies and Gary Speed the Greek striker found the bottom corner with a first time strike  The Magpies were opened up again before half time as Davies set Giannakopoulos in space and Given had to block at his near post  But the home side survived and they should have re taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half  Fernando Hierro cynically chopped down Dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through  But the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby and from the resultant free kick Laurent Robert curled the ball just wide  Bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the Magpies  Their strategy seemed to be working until the  minute  Alan Shearers snap shot was charged down and Dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing Jaaskelainen from six yards       Bolton boss Sam Allardyce  I am bitterly disappointed with the result but I am probably more disappointed with the second half performance   In the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure and our goal matched theirs in quality   I thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half   We allowed them to heap too much pressure on us and in the end we cracked        Newcastle boss Graeme Souness  We deserved the win  We had a really good second half   Bolton are a difficult side to play  You have to match them physically first but we did that and then we played some football   We had a slow first  minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that  The scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals   Newcastle  Given Carr Boumsong Bramble Babayaro Dyer Faye Bowyer Robert Jenas  Ameobi Shearer  Subs Not Used  Butt Harper Milner Hughes  Goals  Bowyer  Dyer   Bolton  Jaaskelainen Hunt Fadiga  NGotty Ben Haim Candela Giannakopoulos Okocha Vaz Te  Hierro Campo  Speed Gardner Davies  Subs Not Used  Jaidi Poole  Booked  Ben Haim Hierro  Goals  Giannakopoulos   Att   Ref  S Dunn Gloucestershire

Parry firm over Gerrard    Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from  GMT     But Parry speaking exclusively to BBC Sport also admits Gerrard who has been constantly linked with Chelsea will have the final say on his future  He told BBC Five Live   Steven is above money  He is the future of Liverpool   It doesnt matter if its       or    we will not accept offers  But we are also realistic enough to know we cant keep Steven against his will   On the subject of Liverpools finances Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium     And responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan  Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July  from a similar role at the Premier League  There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield   and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard     On the subject of Liverpools captain and prize asset Parry revealed Real Madrid    did    ask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes  He said   They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes but the response to Real Madrid was the same   Steven is not for sale   But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season Parry said   I sincerely hope he will be  Steven knows my views  He knows Rafas views   We have re affirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him  We crave success as much as he does  We know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with that      I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than hed like to do anything else   We all want to see progress by next season  Hes not alone in that  There are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim   It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a    plus bid in the summer   but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen   There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven most of which have been complete myths  It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer  We didnt had an offer last summer  Parry explained   We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him  In reality it didnt go beyond that   Maybe there will be an offer in the summer  Maybe there wont      Our position is we want Steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven   and he has enough respect for us   to know that it is his decision that will be crucial   You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will  That just doesnt work but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda  You can forget that   Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpools new stadium in Stanley Park which is set to open in   And he confessed Arsenals    deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground   complete with naming rights   has given the Anfield club serious food for thought  He said   I have to say historically it is something I have been against and I have been on record as saying that but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye opener      I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating   But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow   thats interesting   My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium   Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but Parry countered   I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team   If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it Time will tell   I think the stadium will always be Anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship I think it would be remiss not to   Thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but I think it is clearly something we have to explore      On the subject of possible new investment Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the Middle East  That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board  He also accused Liverpool of using him as  a stalking horse  to attract other bids but Parry explained   Steve has never been used as a stalking horse  Theres no need and that is not the way we do business   We had discussions with Steve over the course of   I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen   Quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it  We are still evaluating it

Wright Phillips to start on right    England coach Sven Goran Eriksson has revealed Shaun Wright Phillips will start against the Netherlands     But Wright Phillips will not make his first start for England playing on the left as had been widely expected   Shaun Wright Phillips will probably start the game  said Eriksson   But Im not going to start Wright Phillips on the left   Eriksson also revealed that Wes Brown will start alongside Jamie Carragher in the injury hit centre of defence  When asked if Brown and Carragher would start Eriksson replied   I could tell you yes   Its a blow that four or five central defenders are away because of injuries   On the other hand its good for Carragher and Brown to show what they can do at this level  Thats positive   The England coach said that he had been impressed by Wright Phillips form for Manchester City   He deserves his chance  He has been playing well all season and I look forward to seeing him   And he added that Andy Johnson and Stewart Downing   the other two new players in the squad   would also get a chance to impress   Wright Phillips Downing and Johnson will start or get the chance to play some part   Johnson was not in my plans a year ago but he is doing a great season and scoring a lot of goals   Downing is another one making a great season  He is young talented and there are not too many left footed players in the squad

Parry relishes Anfield challenge    BBC Sport reflects on the future for Liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive Rick Parry     Chief executive Parry is the man at the helm as Liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history  Parry has to deliver a new  seat stadium in Stanley Park by  amid claims of costs spiralling above     He is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore Liverpool to their place at European footballs top table  But it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with Parry who has forged a reputation as one of footballs most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling Premier League     Liverpool have not won the championship since  a fact that causes deep discomfort inside Anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of Chelsea Manchester United and Arsenal  Throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain Steven Gerrard and you can see Parry is a man with a lot on his plate  But in the comfort of a conference room deep inside Liverpools heartbeat   The Kop end   Parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead  He only dodged one question   when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting Liverpool a polite smile deflected the inquiry  But to his credit he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that Liverpool still mean business     By business he means becoming title challengers again and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to Liverpool is Parrys mission  Parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager Rafael Benitez  And his enthusiasm for the Spaniards personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold  Benitezs early work has given Parry renewed optimism about the years ahead  But it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations  This will not come as news to Parry a lifelong Liverpool supporter but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting       Captain Gerrard is central to Liverpools plans and Parrys insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent  As ever the player will have the final say and Parry acknowledges that but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for Liverpool and Gerrard to flourish     In terms of the search for new investment Hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in March   Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shiniwatra came and went while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan Steve Morgan  Morgan had a succession of bids rejected having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium  BBC Sport understands Morgan is still ready and willing to invest in Liverpool and Parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere     Morgan however has had no formal contact with Liverpool or their advisors since last December blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his    offer  He was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others so any new approach would now have to come from Liverpool  Morgan will certainly not be making another call  So speculation continues about the new benefactor with trails leading to the Middle East and America but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from Anfield     Parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to Liverpools future but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea  He is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future Liverpool management hostages to the new stadium  Parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up but there has been a vital new development in North London that has re shaped Liverpools thinking     Liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights   but the realism of Arsenals stunning    deal for their new Emirates Stadium at Ashburton has changed the landscape  Parry labelled the deal  an eye opener  and admits Liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities  He knows some traditionalist Liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just Anfield but the maths of modern day football decree that multi millions for stadium and team could ease the pain     I would take    if we had no investment but if we did keep him  As for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really       for Gerrard I dont care who you are the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be  We cannot let that sum of money go despite Gerrards quality     Through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which I think is the right thing to do     Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard  Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term  I am hoping he doesnt walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash        realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it  I would however be happy with Gerrards transfer for any fee over        Parrys statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players  Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry     I would keep Gerrard  No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed     The key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy  Clearly if he isnt then we would be foolish not to sell  The worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non Champions League football

Time to get tough on friendlies    For an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players     The only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce  Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the  minutes at the end     I would say its   whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say youre better not doing so  It would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured  But international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing  The more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarter finals against Brazil  Often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first  minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half  And its very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole teams worth  The debate will rage on and Im not sure there is a satisfactory solution  One manager who has got it right this week is Walter Smith  The new Scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing Berti Vogts  It is the sort of move you would expect from Walter who is a canny manager     The players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next World Cup qualifiers  If he had sent them out on Wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever  John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary  He will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results  Its extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies  If you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you  Englands game against Holland is a good example  It looks like a good opportunity to try out players like Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing or Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson  But you have got to remember Sven Goran Erikssons side were given a lesson by Spain in the last game they played     The injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher a chance to impress  For the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed

Barcelona title hopes hit by loss    Barcelonas pursuit of the Spanish title took a blow on Sunday as they fell to a   defeat at home to Atletico Madrid     Fernando Torres gave Athletico an ideal start with a goal in the first minute  Ronaldino wasted a second half chance to equalise for Barca when he put a penalty wide but Torres made no such mistake with a last minute spot kick  The defeat coupled with Real Madrids   win over Espanyol on Saturday reduces Barcas lead to four points  Former Everton midfielder Thomas Gravesen scored his first goal for Real in the comfortable victory at the Bernabeu  Zinedine Zidane had opened the scoring before Raul bagged a brace  Gravesen who replaced Zidane completed the scoring in the  minute with a low shot  David Beckham watched by Sven Goran Eriksson came off in the  minute with a shoulder injury but should be fit for Englands game against Holland  England team mate Michael Owen came on for Raul after  minutes with the game already won  Real have now won six consecutive Primera Liga games since coach Wanderley Luxemburgo took charge

Parry puts Gerrard above money    Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from  GMT     But Parry speaking exclusively to BBC Sport also admits Gerrard who has been constantly linked with Chelsea will have the final say on his future  He told BBC Five Live   Steven is above money  He is the future of Liverpool   It doesnt matter if its       or    we will not accept offers  But we are also realistic enough to know we cant keep Steven against his will   On the subject of Liverpools finances Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium     And responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan  Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July  from a similar role at the Premier League  There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield   and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard     On the subject of Liverpools captain and prize asset Parry revealed Real Madrid    did    ask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes  He said   They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes but the response to Real Madrid was the same   Steven is not for sale   But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season Parry said   I sincerely hope he will be  Steven knows my views  He knows Rafas views   We have re affirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him  We crave success as much as he does  We know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with that      I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than hed like to do anything else   We all want to see progress by next season  Hes not alone in that  There are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim   It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a    plus bid in the summer   but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen   There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven most of which have been complete myths  It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer  We didnt had an offer last summer  Parry explained   We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him  In reality it didnt go beyond that   Maybe there will be an offer in the summer  Maybe there wont      Our position is we want Steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven   and he has enough respect for us   to know that it is his decision that will be crucial   You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will  That just doesnt work but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda  You can forget that   Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpools new stadium in Stanley Park which is set to open in   And he confessed Arsenals    deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground   complete with naming rights   has given the Anfield club serious food for thought  He said   I have to say historically it is something I have been against and I have been on record as saying that but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye opener      I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating   But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow   thats interesting   My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium   Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but Parry countered   I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team   If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it Time will tell   I think the stadium will always be Anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship I think it would be remiss not to   Thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but I think it is clearly something we have to explore      On the subject of possible new investment Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the Middle East  That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board  He also accused Liverpool of using him as  a stalking horse  to attract other bids but Parry explained   Steve has never been used as a stalking horse  Theres no need and that is not the way we do business   We had discussions with Steve over the course of   I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen   Quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it  We are still evaluating it   Steves interest was taken very much on its own merits  His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold  The door isnt closed on anything  We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year   We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful  Thats a dream we all share so as far as Im concerned the door is not closed      I would take    if we had no investment but if we did keep him  As for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really       for Gerrard I dont care who you are

Reaction from Spanish press    Englands   defeat to Spain on Wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the countrys press on Thursday     Controversy was in no short supply with racist abuse of Englands black players Wayne Rooneys petulance and Englands inept performance  But what did the Spanish press make of the affair BBC Sport looks at the reaction           There is little coverage of the racist chanting on Wednesday nights game  But AS does cover the English reaction to the pre match comments from Spain coach Luis Aragones who highlighted Britains colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding Thierry Henry in October  Journalist Guillem Balague writes   In our country where multi culturalism is a new thing we are in nappies dealing with these things and have a naivety which makes the English nervous      Marca refers in passing to the booing of Englands black players   but only after referring to the cheers of  ole  which greeted the long periods of Spanish possession  Aragones  no comment  to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted as Marca focuses on the Spanish coachs praise for his players  Serbia   Montenegros   World Cup qualifying win in Belgium   which could make qualification tougher for Spain   seems to be of greater importance     Elsewhere the Spanish media criticises its English counterparts for stoking up the racism issue   Were there racist chants against some players This hasnt happened in the Spanish league and Spain for many years  said Spanish Federation press officer Fernando Garrido   So you English reporters should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this   And Spanish daily ABC accuses English reporters of launching a witch hunt against Aragones   Perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue  the paper says            What the boy in the Bernabeu did was odd    Rooney seemed intent to kick any Spanish player who approached him   Yet Rooney is seen only as the worst example of many England miscreants with Gary Neville criticised for continuing the feud between Manchester United and Arsenal for his tackles on Jose Reyes  Ashley Coles treatment of Joaquin and a Frank Lampard foul on Reyes are also lambasted for their  ugliness      Marcas headline says it all   Wayne Rooney se volvi    loco en el Bernab   u Wayne Rooney became crazy in the Bernabeu  Rooneys display alarms the writer in particular three  chilling  fouls on Joaquin Casillas and Marchena which  could well have left them in the infirmary   And like AS Marca criticises Gary Neville for  leaving a message on Reyes ankle  to remind him of the Manchester United Arsenal clash this month           Spains first half performance is showered with praise with Xavi singled out as the biggest star   Xavi did things on Wednesday which were worthy of Maradona  the paper beams adding  What a work rate what dynamism what vision what leadership what a midfield player!  On a controversial evening AS offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint   Spanish football players played better football than the English      More plaudits are given to the home team with Jaime Vargas lauding the manner in which  Spain dominated England with order and quality   The paper adds   The bad thing about Spain v England was that it lasted only  minutes after which a succession of changes prevented any real competition   Vargas does not mention Englands two Galacticos simply adding in a PS   I have not forgotten to speak of Beckham and Owen  They forgot to play

Kerr frustrated at victory margin    Republic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over Croatia     Robbie Keane took his Republic record to  with a first half goal which proved enough for victory   We had more good chances  It is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team  said Kerr   But given the conditions and the standard of the Croatian team we should be very happy with the win   The Republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in  matches and are unbeaten in  home games since Kerr succeeded Mick McCarthy  Kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory   It was a brilliant goal fantastic skill by Damien Duff  Robbie might have scuffed it a little but it was a good goal   Matchwinner Keane was another full of praise for Duffs role in the goal   It was great play from Damien  said the Tottenham striker      I always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of  Duffer is going to get it in the box   Playing three up was something different  Brian Kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young Stephen Elliott getting a run out   The conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future  It is nice to see young players coming through   Man of the match Duff explained what went wrong when he fluffed a chance to make it   midway through the second half  He opted to bring Steve Finnans cross down and shoot against the bar when a close range header looked the best option   I would have headed that every time but I completely lost it in the lights  said the Chelsea star   I was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing   We have had a good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers  Hopefully that can continue in

Mourinho plots impressive course    Chelseas win at Fulham   confirming their position at the Premiership summit   proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season     They have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in Jose Mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match  All they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all  One thing is certain   they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed  They beat a very tough Everton at Stamford Bridge won at Newcastle in the Carling Cup and then won   at Fulham which was a great result given that they had been showing good form  As I said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in Mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now  Mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the Champions League and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players  It is a priceless commodity  No one can be anything other than highly impressed by Mourinho  He is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk  Mourinho doesnt simply talk a good game   hes won some very big games such as the Champions League final with Porto  Some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions  Ive also found him to be very realistic whenever Ive heard him  Hes spent a lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked  The buys are now integrating and in Arjen Robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension     In the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games  You cannot win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital  I also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful  Now they are taking those chances have the double threat of Robben and Damien Duff and things are looking good  I just wonder if they lack a predator particularly with Didier Drogba injured  He was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if Chelsea had a Ruud van Nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title  Chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the Champions League  I felt they would never have a better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in Europe so far this season  It will now be very interesting to see how Mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of Chelseas squad  I have said I believed Chelsea would win the league this season even when Arsenal were flying at the start and I have seen nothing to make me change me mind     If anything what I have seen has confirmed my early impressions  And Chelsea would have taken encouragement from Arsenals rocky defensive display at Spurs even though they ran out   winners  Mourinho had his say on that game complaining   Five four is a hockey score not a football score   In a three against three training match if the score reaches   I send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly   So to get a result like that in a game of  against  is disgraceful      On a more serious note it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of Sol Campbell to Arsenal  Much criticism has been aimed at Pascal Cygan but I believe the problem lies with the absence of Campbell and its overall effect on Arsenals defence  Confidence is a crucial factor in defending  When you start conceding goals you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area  You think  oh no    then find your worst fears confirmed  Arsenal need to reverse the process with or without Campbell and get some clean sheets on the board  But the return of Campbell is key  He solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck  He is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him  Campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit  Chelsea have no such problems at present which is why I would still place my money on them to edge out Arsenal as champions this season

Benitez delight after crucial win    Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez admitted victory against Deportivo La Coruna was vital in their tight Champions League group     Jorge Andrades early own goal gave Liverpool a   win  And Benitez said   We started at a very high tempo and had many chances  It is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals   We were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack  We are pleased but move on to the next game   Igor Biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured Xabi Alonso and Benitez said   He played very well   It is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level   Benitez added   It is all back in our own hands now it was a great win for us and I was delighted with what I feel was the best Liverpool I have seen   As far as my feelings about winning in Spain that is really not important   I want to see us win away matches in the Champions League that it was in Spain was not my first consideration   As far as I am concerned it is important for Liverpool to win it is not important in what country it is in   Benitez added  Benitez said   We had a problem before the start it was decided that Xabi could not play more than  minutes   But in the end because of the way that Dietmar Hamann and Igor Biscan performed we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match   Depor are a good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed   But we knew that if we hit them on the counter attack it would make them nervous and that is how it worked out   Deportivo coach Javier Irureta said   Liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down   I know we have now gone six games at home in Europe without scoring but that does not reflect our overall performances   But this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination   The goal was a bad mistake and a big blow to our confidence  Players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it   I know we are bottom of the group but as long as there is hope of qualifying we will hang on to that

Wenger steps up row    Arsene Wenger has stepped up his feud with Sir Alex Ferguson by claiming the Manchester United manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute     The pairs long running row was put back in the headlines on Saturday when Ferguson said his Arsenal counterpart was  a disgrace   Wenger initially refused to bite back saying only   I will never answer any questions any more about this man   But now he claims Ferguson should be punished by the Football Association  The latest twist in the Ferguson Wenger saga came on Saturday when the United boss in an interview with The Independent newspaper discussed the events after the game between the two sides in October  United won   that day at Old Trafford but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw Fergusons clothes covered in soup and pizza  The sides meet again at Highbury on  February   In the tunnel Wenger was criticising my players calling them cheats so I told him to leave them alone and behave himself  Ferguson said on Saturday   He ran at me with hands raised saying what do you want to do about it  To not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable  Its a disgrace but I dont expect Wenger to ever apologise hes that type of person      Those allegations were put to Wenger after Saturdays game at Bolton which Arsenal lost to slip  points behind Chelsea in the title race  At first he said only   Ive always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened   If he has to talk he talks  If he wants to make a newspaper article he makes a newspaper article   He doesnt interest me and doesnt matter to me at all  I will never answer to any provocation from him any more   He does what he likes in England anyway  He can go abroad one day and see how it is   But later on Saturday according to The Independent Wenger spoke to a smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction   I have no diplomatic relations with him  the Arsenal boss is quoted as saying   What I dont understand is that he does what he wants and you the press are all at his feet      The situation concerning the food fight has been judged and there is a game going on in a month   The managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game  But in England you are only punished for what you say after the game   Now the whole story starts again  I dont go into that game  We play football  I am a football manager and I love football above all     no matter what people say   Reminded that Ferguson called him  a disgrace  Wenger added   I dont respond to anything  In England you have a good phrase  It is bringing the game into disrepute   But that is not only after a game it is as well before a game      Ferguson had also claimed that United chief executive David Gill and Arsenal vice chairman David Dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public  But Ferguson added   In the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from Arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense  Gill phoned Dein three times to complain but nothing was done   The return is on  February and they will come out with another diatribe   David Gill and I feel we should set the record straight because Arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here   Meanwhile the League Managers Association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on going row  During that stormy game in October United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy caught Arsenals Ashley Cole with one particularly strong tackle  Wenger later accused Van Nistelrooy of  cheating  and was fined    and  severely reprimanded  by the Football Association  Ferguson admitted on Saturday that Van Nistelrooys tackle which earned the Dutchman a ban  could have given Cole a serious injury  but he believes Arsenal were the main aggressors      Wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit  he added   They are the worst losers of all time they dont know how to lose  Maybe it is just Manchester United they dont lose many games to other teams   We tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was Arsenals up until last season  In fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue   But to Wenger it never happens it is all some dream or nightmare

Campbell rescues Arsenal    Sol Campbell proved to be an unlikely match winner to earn Arsenal a hard fought win at Portsmouth     The England defender lashed home a  yard shot for his first goal in  months to take Arsenal back into second spot five points behind Chelsea  But before Campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to Pompey striker Ricardo Fuller  In the first half he blasted wide when clear and his control let him down in the second half when well placed  Portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny Arsenal space in the early stages  But their marking was slack at a corner and Patrick Vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him  yards out  A mistake by Arjan de Zeeuw let Thierry Henry in behind the Pompey defence on  minutes but as he bore down on goal Linvoy Primus got in a saving tackle  With just Fuller as an out and out striker Portsmouths shape made life difficult for Arsenal  But a delightful touch by Robin van Persie gave Henry a sight of goal although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble Jamie Ashdown     Ashdown caused hearts to flutter on  minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and Kolo Toure headed just wide and as Arsenal began to press Van Persie blasted over a good opportunity after Henry had set him up  Henry took a quick return pass from Vieira but Ashdown was out quickly to block and there were some anxious seconds for Pompey as the ball ran loose before Matthew Taylor cleared  After playing second fiddle Portsmouth should have taken the lead on  minutes  Referee Howard Webb played a good advantage to allow Steve Stone to send Gary ONeil away but having shrugged off Toure the Pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from  yards  As half time approached Henry teased a shot through a ruck of players and inches wide  At the other end Fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as Toure closed him down     Fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on  minutes when Patrik Bergers break and slipped pass played him clear  But a poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under Vieiras challenge referee Webb was not interested  Fuller paid the price when he gave way on  minutes to Aiyegbeni Yakubu who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury  But it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from Ashdown to cling on to Van Persies shot as Henry sniffed for scraps     Portsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper Manuel Almunia had to stand his ground to beat away a powerful shot from Berger  Arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of Campbell  The England defender needed little invitation as Pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past Ashdown  Arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when Mathieu Flamini escaped his marker to flash a header wide from Henrys free kick  Almunia went full length to grab Bergers long range shot while Ashdown palmed away substitute Dennis Bergkamps shot     Ashdown Griffin De Zeeuw Primus Taylor Stone ONeil Faye Berkovic  Berger LuaLua Fuller Yakubu      Subs not used  Hislop Quashie Cisse     Almunia Lauren Toure Campbell Cole Pires Flamini Vieira Clichy Van Persie Bergkamp  Henry     Subs not used  Lehmann Fabregas Senderos Hoyte     Cole     Campbell           H Webb S Yorkshire
