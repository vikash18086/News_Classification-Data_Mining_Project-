Ink helps drive democracy in Asia    The Kyrgyz Republic a small mountainous state of the former Soviet republic is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the countrys elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting     This new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population  In an effort to live up to its reputation in the  as  an island of democracy  the Kyrgyz President Askar Akaev pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections  The US government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision     The Kyrgyz Republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid  with a hastily pushed through referendum in  reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with  deputies  The use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections   the German Embassy the Soros Foundation and the Kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes     The actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated  The ink is sprayed on a persons left thumb  It dries and is not visible under normal light     However the presence of ultraviolet light of the kind used to verify money causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light  At the entrance to each polling station one election official will scan voters fingers with UV lamp before allowing them to enter and every voter will have his her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot  If the ink shows under the UV light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station  Likewise any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot  These elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors   the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the Autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former Soviet Republics notably Ukraine and Georgia  The use of ink has been controversial   especially among groups perceived to be pro government     Widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep   a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society     The author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink  The greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance  Local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems  Others such as the aggressively middle of the road Coalition of Non governmental Organizations have lauded the move as an important step forward  This type of ink has been used in many elections in the world in countries as varied as Serbia South Africa Indonesia and Turkey  The other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink   but as the elections in Afghanistan showed improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems  The use of  invisible  ink is not without its own problems  In most elections numerous rumors have spread about it     In Serbia for example both Christian and Islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion  Other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink   various soft drinks solvents and cleaning products are put forward  However in reality the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off  The ink stays on the finger for at least  hours and for up to a week  The use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills  The passage of the inking law is nevertheless a clear step forward towards free and fair elections   The countrys widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for  February     David Mikosz works for the IFES an international non profit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies

China net cafe culture crackdown    Chinese authorities closed  net cafes in the closing months of  the countrys government said     According to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally  Chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools  The move is the latest in a series of steps the Chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use     The official Xinhua News Agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a  safer environment for young people in China   Rules introduced in  demand that net cafes be at least  metres away from middle and elementary schools  The hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated  China has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people  The  cafes were shut in the three months from October to December  China also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to     Net cafes are hugely popular in China because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have PCs in their homes  This is not the first time that the Chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines  All the  or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see  Logs of sites people visit are also kept  Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in  following a fire at one cafe that killed  people  During the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate  In August  Chinese authorities shut down  websites and arrested  people in a crackdown on net porn  At the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites  The Reporters Without Borders group said in a report that Chinese government technologies for e mail interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world

Digital guru floats sub   PC    Nicholas Negroponte chairman and founder of MITs Media Labs says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than          He told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries  He said one laptop per child could be   very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood   He said the child could use the laptop like a text book  He described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a Linux based operating system  We have to get the display down to below   to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel      The second trick is to get rid of the fat  if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory   The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down  Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money  In  Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age  The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on     While the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken  However Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops   We put in  laptops three years ago  only one has been broken the kids cherish these things its also a TV a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook   Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious   Nokia make  million cell phones a year so for us to claim were going to make  million laptops is a big number but were not talking about doing it in three or five years were talking about months   He plans to be distributing them by the end of  and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order   In China they spend   per child per year on textbooks  Thats for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education thats cheaper and the marketing overheads go away

Technology gets the creative bug    The hi tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required     Often this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision  But that dance is growing more intimate as hi tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration  And vice versa  UK telco BT is serious about the idea and has launched its Connected World initiative  The idea says BT is to shape a   Century model  which will help cement the art technology and business worlds together   We are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology  said Frank Stone head of the BTs business sector programmes  He looks after several  centres of excellence  which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations one of which is focused on creative industries     To mark the initiatives launch a major international art installation is to open on  April in Brussels with a further exhibit in Madrid later in the summer  They have both been created using the telcos technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm including a sophisticated graphics rendering program  Using a  graphics engine the type commonly used in gaming Bafta winning artists Langlands   Bell have created a virtual story based  model of Brussels Coudenberg Cellars     They have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of Coudenberg Palace an historical seat of European power  The  world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the  Century   The river was integral to the citys survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared  said the artists   We hope that by uncovering the river we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present and appreciate the flow of modernity once concealing but now revealing the River Senne   In their previous works they used the Quake game graphics engine  The game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering game AI and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game  They are so time consuming and expensive to create the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics intensive games  BTs own engine Tara Total Abstract Rendering Architecture has been in development since  and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners  It was also used in  in Encounter an urban based pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical on the street action  Because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds new features were added to Tara in order to handle the complex data sets  But collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new and many keen coders designers games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself     As more tools for self expression are given to the person on the street enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance creativity will become an integral part of technology  The Orange Expressionist exhibition last year for example displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the UK to create an interactive installation     Technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential not least because it gives people something to do with their technology  Big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too  The art world is  fantastically rich  said Mr Stone with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like BT want to get in with them  Between  and  the creative industry brought    billion to London alone  It is an industry that is growing by   a year too  The partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net according to Mr Stone   This is not just about putting art galleries and museums online  he said   It is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem   With broadband penetration reaching   in the UK businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it  The creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously  It is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries or more patent ideas for tech companies   What we are trying to do is have outside in thinking   We are creating a future cultural drive for the economy  said Mr Stone

Wi fi web reaches farmers in Peru    A network of community computer centres linked by wireless technology is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in Peru     The pilot scheme in the Huaral Valley  kilometres north of the capital Lima aims to offer the  strong community up to date information on agricultural market prices and trends  The Agricultural Information Project for Farmers of the Chancay Huaral Valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation enabling them to coordinate their actions  More than  rural inhabitants as well as  students in the region will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure     The  telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment  The network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in September     The non government organisation Cepes Peruvian Centre for Social Studies led the   project also backed by local institutions the Education and Agriculture ministries and European development organisations   The plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system  said Carlos Saldarriaga technical coordinator at Cepes  Farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land  The Board of Irrigation Users which runs the computer centres aims to make the network self sustainable within three years through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes     One of the key elements of the project is the Agricultural Information System with its flagship huaral org website  There farmers can find the prices for local produce as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques  The system also helps the inhabitants of the Chancay Huaral Valley to organise their vital irrigation systems   Water is the main element that unites them all  It is a precious element in Perus coastal areas because it is so scarce and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it  Mr Saldarriaga told the BBC News website  The information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of Peru and even around the world     Cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the projects success   Throughout the last three years the people have provided a vital thrust to the project  they feel it belongs to them  said Mr Saldarriaga  The community training sessions attended by an equal number of men and women have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm   We have had an excellent response mainly from young people  But we have also had a great feedback when we trained  or  year old women who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives   So far the Huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers organisations in Peru   This is a pilot project and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places  underlined Mr Saldarriaga     The Cepes researcher recalls what happened in Cuyo a  family community with no electricity during the construction of the local telecentre site  There it was necessary to build a mini hydraulic dam in order to generate  worth of power for the computers the communications equipment and the cabin lights   It was already dark when the technicians realised they didnt have any light bulbs to test the generator so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs  recalls Carlos Saldarriaga   The logical answer was we dont sell any so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing   Now with the wireless network Cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated

Apple laptop is greatest gadget    The Apple Powerbook  has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by US magazine Mobile PC     The  laptop was chosen because it was one of the first  lightweight  portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs  The magazine has compiled an all time top  list of gadgets which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the  Zenith remote control at two  Gadgets needed moving parts and or electronics to warrant inclusion  The magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a  self contained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device       In general we included only items that were potentially mobile  said the magazine      In the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget  it concluded  The oldest  gadget  in the top  is the abacus which the magazine dates at  A D  and put in  place  Other pre electronic gadgets in the top  include the sextant from   position the marine chronometer from   position and the Kodak Brownie camera from   position  The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top  which also includes the first flash mp player Diamound Multimedia as well as the first  successful  digital camera Casio QV  and mobile phone Motorola Startac  The most popular gadget of the moment the Apple iPod is at number  in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number      Sonys third entry in the top  is the CDP  CD player from    Who can forget the crystalline hiss free blast of Madonnas Like A Virgin emenating from their first CD player  asked the magazine  Karl Elseners knife the Swiss Army Knife from  is at number  in the list  Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone  the Nintendo GameBoy  and the Pulsar quartz digital watch   The list also contains plenty of oddities  the Pez sweet dispenser   toy Tamagotchi  and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler      Why worry about mobile phones  Soon they will be subsumed into the PDAs   laptops etc     What about the Marine Chronometer Completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries  For its time a technological marvel!    Sony Net Minidisc! It paved the way for more mp player to explode onto the market  I always used my NetMD and could not go anywhere without it     A laptop computer is not a gadget! Its a working tool!    The Sinclair Executive was the worlds first pocket calculator  I think this should be there as well     How about the clockwork radio Or GPS Or a pocket calculator All these things are useful to real people not just PC magazine editors     Are the people who created this list insane  Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone It has revolutionalised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop  From outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly     Has everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker    An interesting list  Of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early  blessed the original noteboook pc   the Tandy   The size of A paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem  A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible     Whats an Apple Powerbook   Its out of date   not much of a  gadget   Surely it has to be something simple   timeless   the tin opener Swiss Army Knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves     It has to be the mobile phone  No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time     The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever  Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule     The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in   A true gadget it could be carried around and shown off     All top  are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high tech obsession than anyhting else  I say this as the Swiss Army Knife only made No      Sinclair QL a machine far ahead of its time  The first home machine with a true multi takings OS  Shame the marketing was so bad!!!    Apple   a triumph of fashion over    well everything else     Utter rubbish  Yes the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets  But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective  The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see  The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed  No competition     Id also put Apples Newton and the first Palm Pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason  I only wish that Vulcan Incs Flipstart wasnt just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top     How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise What about radios and TVs    The swiss army knife  By far the most useful gadget  I got mine  years ago  Still wearing and using it a lot!

Why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site Its obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that     The Motorola Startac should be Number One  Why There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices     The Psion series ! The first most practical way to carry all your info around       I too would back the Sinclair Spectrum   without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now     Id have put the mobile phone high up the list  Probably a Nokia model     Sinclair Spectrum     It plugged into the tv  Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and thats what I do for a living now     I wish more modern notebooks    even Apples newest offerings    were more like the PB  Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless  trackpad  which every notebook on the market today uses  Theyre invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use     Congratulations to Apple a deserved win!

Googles toolbar sparks concern    Search engine firm Google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre selected commercial websites     The AutoLink feature comes with Googles latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to Amazon com if it finds a books ISBN number on the site  It also links to Googles map service if there is an address or to car firm Carfax if there is a licence plate  Google said the feature available only in the US  adds useful links   But some users are concerned that Googles dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like Amazon     AutoLink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage   even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission     If a user clicks the AutoLink feature in the Google toolbar then a webpage with a books unique ISBN number would link directly to Amazons website  It could mean online libraries that list ISBN book numbers find they are directing users to Amazon com whether they like it or not  Websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services  Dan Gillmor founder of Grassroots Media which supports citizen based media said the tool was a  bad idea and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth   In a statement Google said the feature was still only in beta ie trial stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users  It said   The user can choose never to click on the AutoLink button and web pages she views will never be modified   In addition the user can choose to disable the AutoLink feature entirely at any time      The new tool has been compared to the Smart Tags feature from Microsoft by some users  It was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by Microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised  Smart Tags allowed Microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company  Google said none of the companies which received AutoLinks had paid for the service  Some users said AutoLink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any  click through  to a commercial site  Cory Doctorow European outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group Electronic Fronter Foundation said that Google should not be penalised for its market dominance   Of course Google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses   But as an end user I would want to know   Can I choose to use this service How much is Google being paid Can I substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by Google   Mr Doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using AutoLink or  tricked into using the service

UK pioneers digital film network    The worlds first digital cinema network will be established in the UK over the next  months     The UK Film Council has awarded a contract worth     to Arts Alliance Digital Cinema AADC who will set up the network of up to  screens  AADC will oversee the selection of cinemas across the UK which will use the digital equipment  High definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly British and specialist films  Most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to  screens in up to  cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images  The new network will double the worlds total of digital screens  Cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server     Each film is about  gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte size file  Fiona Deans associate director of AADC said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur     The film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie   People will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches   The picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made   there is no degradation in quality over time      The key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of British films documentaries and foreign language films      Access to specialised film is currently restricted across the UK  said Pete Buckingham head of Distribution and Exhibition at the UK Film Council   Although a genuine variety of films is available in central London and a few other metropolitan areas the choice for many outside these areas remains limited and the Digital Screen Network will improve access for audiences across the UK  Digital prints costs less than a traditional  print   giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films said Ms Deans   It can cost up to    to make a copy of a print for specialist films   In the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that   Distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer   The UK digital network will be the first to employ  projectors   which are capable of showing films at resolutions of     pixels  A separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in May  The sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs   Some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum   they dont need to be shown twice a day  explained Ms Deans   A cinema will often book a  print in for two weeks   even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema   With digital prints every cinema will have its own copy

EU software patent law faces axe    The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented     Politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law  During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re drafted or even scrapped  The bill was backed by some hi tech firms saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile     Hugo Lueders European director for public policy at CompTIA an umbrella organization for technology companies said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper  He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents  Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software  But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement  The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament  Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it  Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee JURI said the law should be re drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs  To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill  The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re consideration

Xbox power cable fire fear    Microsoft has said it will replace more than  million power cables for its Xbox consoles due to safety concerns     The company said the move was a  preventative step  after reports of fire hazard problems with the cables  It affects Xboxes made before  October  for all regions but mainland Europe   and consoles in that region made before  January   Microsoft said it had received  reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables  The firm said fewer than one in  consoles had experienced component failures  The recall affects almost three quarters of all Xboxes sold around the world since its launch in      In a statement it added   In almost all instances any damage caused by these failures was contained within the console itself or limited to the tip of the power cord at the back of the console   But in seven cases customers reported sustaining a minor burn to their hand  In  cases customers reported smoke damage or minor damage to a carpet or entertainment centre   This is a preventative step were choosing to take despite the rarity of these incidents  said Robbie Bach senior vice president Microsoft home and entertainment division   We regret the inconvenience but believe offering consumers a free replacement cord is the responsible thing to do   Consumers can order a new cable from the Xbox website or by telephoning    in the UK  Microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order  It advised users to turn off their Xboxes when not in use  A follow up to Xbox is expected to released at the end of this year or the beginning of

Global blogger action day called    The global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned Iranian bloggers     The month old Committee to Protect Bloggers is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on  February to the  Free Mojtaba and Arash Day   Arash Sigarchi and Mojtaba Saminejad are both in prison in Iran  Blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions  Iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time   I hope this day will focus people  Curt Hopkins director of the Committee told the BBC News website     The group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take including writing to local Iranian embassies  The Committee has deemed Tuesday  Free Mojtaba and Arash Day  as part of its first campaign  It is calling on the blogsphere   the name for the worldwide community of bloggers   to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of Mojtaba and Arash as well as other  cyber dissidents    If you have a blog the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except Free Mojtaba and Arash Day  said Mr Hopkins   That would mean you could see that phrase   million times  That alone will shine some light on the situation   If you dont have one find one dedicated to that   it takes about  seconds   Technorati a blog search engine tracks about six million blogs and says that more than  are added daily  A blog is created every   seconds according to a US research think tank     The Committee to Protect Bloggers was started by US blogger Curt Hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger Ellen Simonetti as a deputy director  She has since started the International Bloggers Bill of Rights a global petition to protect bloggers at work  Although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means it aims to be the hub or organisation information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech     The Committee although only a month old aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future and will operate as a non for profit organisation   Blogging is in this weird no mans land  People think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view  said Mr Hopkins   Some think of themselves as pundits kind of like journalists and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform   But they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold      It is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers  The question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently  High profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal and often anonymous blogs have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in      This is a big messy argument  explained Mr Hopkins  He added   It is just such a new way of doing business there will be clamp downs   But the way these issues get tested is through the courts which said Mr Hopkins  is part of the whole messy conversation    If you havent already got bloggers in your company you will have them tomorrow   and if you dont have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one  Mr Hopkins said that the blogsphere   which is doubling every five months   was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog   Everyone does this   mums radicals conservatives  he said  Many companies offer easy to use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community   That is the essential difference  What I call templating software gives every single person on Earth the chance to have one   You dont even have to have your own computer

Intel unveils laser breakthrough    Intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light     Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light  The breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information  The Intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade      Weve overcome a fundamental limit  said Dr Mario Paniccia director of Intels photonics technology lab  Writing in the journal Nature Dr Paniccia   and colleagues Haisheng Rong Richard Jones Ansheng Liu Oded Cohen Dani Hak and Alexander Fang   show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors  Currently says Dr Paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it     Telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high volume manufacturing have been solved   Were trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas  said Dr Paniccia  While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances  This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables  This improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips  Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material   It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light  he said  But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light  Even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy to make filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies  Semi conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges  The result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it  Dr Paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses   Its a technical validation that it can work  he said

Warnings about junk mail deluge    The amount of spam circulating online could be about to undergo a massive increase say experts     Anti spam group Spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail  The program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out  Spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent     Before now many spammers have recruited home PCs to act as anonymous e mail relays in an attempt to hide the origins of their junk mail  The PCs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program  Once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers  Spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines  But the novel worm spotted recently by Spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place  In this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate  As blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical Spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped  Steve Linford director of Spamhaus predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the nets e mail sending infrastructure  David Stanley UK managing director of filtering firm Ciphertrust said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers   They are adding to their armoury  he said  The amount of spam in circulation was still growing said Mr Stanley but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e mail meltdown  But Kevin Hogan senior manager at Symantec security response said such warnings were premature   If something like this mean the end of e mail then e mail would have stopped two three years ago  said Mr Hogan  While the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too  Mr Hogan said   of the junk mail filtered by Symantec subsidiary Brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses  For instance said Mr Hogan filtering out e mail messages that contain a web link can stop about   of spam

Warning over tsunami aid website    Net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims     The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official Disasters Emergency Committee webpage  However DEC has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it  The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster     The link to the website is contained in a spam e mail that is currently circulating  The messages subject line reads  Urgent Tsunami Earthquake Appeal  and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts  The web address of the fake site is decuk org which could be close enough to the official www dec org uk address to confuse some people keen to donate  Patricia Sanders spokeswoman for the Disaster Emergency Committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the Computer Crime Unit at Scotland Yard to help get it shut down  She said the spam e mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered  It is thought that the fake site is being run from Romania  Ms Sanders said DEC had contacted US net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web     DEC was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation  BT and DECs hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down she said     Ms Sanders said sending out spam e mail to solicit donations was not DECs style and that it would never canvass support in this way  She said that DEC hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible  All attempts by the BBC News website to contact the people behind the site have failed  None of the e mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records  This is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid  One e mail sent out in early January came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the Netherlands  The con was very similar to the familiar Nigerian forward fee fraud e mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile  Other scam e mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information  In a monthly report anti virus firm Sophos said that two e mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top  hoax list during January  Another tsunami related e mail is also circulating that carries the Zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of Microsofts Outlook e mail program  Anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to

Open source leaders slam patents    The war of words between Microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as Linux founder Linus Torvalds led an attack on software patents     In a panel discussion at a Linux summit in California Mr Torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement  Mitchell Kapor chairman of the Mozilla foundation warned that Microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future  Linux is a freely available alternative to Microsofts Windows  It relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees  The attack on software patents comes at a time when IBM has made  of its patents freely available  Other companies are expected to follow suit     There are between  and  registered software patents in the US and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted  This is a view corroborated by the UK Patent Office   Some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they cant afford to take them to court  said Dr Jeremy Philpott of the UK Patent Office  Some panel members are worried that Microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future   If totally pushed to the wall   because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software   of course theyre going to unleash the WMDs  Mr Kapor is reported as saying  Microsoft did not want to comment directly referring the issue instead to trade body Intellect of which it is a member   As far as Intellect is concerned open source and patents have co existed for many years without problems  said spokeswoman Jill Sutherland   The industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software   We think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries and not be forced into using one or the other  she added

Reboot ordered for EU patent law    A European Parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new European Union rules which govern computer based inventions     The Legal Affairs Committee JURI said the Commission should re submit the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive after MEPs failed to back it  It has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open source software innovation  Supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions  The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words  computer implemented invention   The draft law suffered setbacks when Poland one of the largest EU member states rejected its adoption twice in two months  Intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure  Only two MEPs backed the draft law at the JURI meeting with one voting to abstain     Opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the EU a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states  In the US the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted  This means that the US based Amazon com holds a patent for its  one click shopping  service for example  Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe  This they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court  Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US

Solutions to net security fears    Fake bank e mails or phishing and stories about ID theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce say e business experts     Trust in online security is falling as a result  Almost   of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people  The survey of more than  people reported that   were not willing to hand over personal information online  It is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net  More people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats said security firm RSA which carried out the poll  An estimated  million Britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs  Security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e commerce and e banking are being taken seriously   by banks in particular      I dont think the threat is overplayed  Barry Beal global security manager for Capgemini told the BBC News website  He added   The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability   Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said   Card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves  If we do that they will indemnify us  he said  Many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though  One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individuals identity  Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget  Last year a street survey found that more than   of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate     On average people have to remember four different passwords  Some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts  Those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer  In a separate survey by RSA   said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems  For many the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard     Activcard is just one of the many companies like RSA Security which has been trying to come up with just that  RSA has a deal with internet provider AOL that lets people pay monthly for a one time passcode generation service  Users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for  seconds  Many companies use a token based method already for employees to access networks securely already  Activcards method is more complex  It is currently trailing its one time passcode generation technology with UK banks  Steve Ash from Activcard told the BBC News website there are two parts to the process of identification  The most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online      The end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both   The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time  This can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as  seconds before it changes  It combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions   You take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and a code is given   If you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction   The clever bit happens back at the banks secure servers  The code is validated by the banks systems matching the information they expect with the customers unique key   Each individual gets a key which is unique to them  It is a  bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack  said Mr Ash  It means that in a typical security attack explains Mr Ash even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode   By the time they go back  to use the information  the code has expired so they cant prove who they are  according to Mr Ash  In the next few years Mr Ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use   PCs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards   The gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants PDAs and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them   The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around  he said

Mobile networks seek turbo boost    Third generation mobile  networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services     That was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the  World Congress in Cannes last week  Fast  networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the Global Mobile Suppliers Association  At  Siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data  The German company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second   up to  times faster than current  networks  The system is not available commercially yet but Motorola the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on HSDPA High Speed Downlink Packet Access a high speed high bandwidth technology available now  Early HSDPA systems typically offer around two megabits per second Mbps compared with less than  kilobits per second Kbps on standard  networks      High Speed Downlink Packet Access HSDPA   sometimes called Super    will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips  according to a report published by UK based research consultancy Analysys  A number of companies are developing the technology  Nokia and Canada based wireless communication products company Sierra Wireless recently agreed to work together on High Speed Downlink Packet Access  The two companies aim to jointly market the HSDPA solution to global network operator customers      While HSDPA theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of  practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide area networks  said Dr Alastair Brydon author of the Analysys report  Pushing Beyond the Limits of  with HSDPA and Other Enhancements   The typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity    when compared to basic WCDMA     he added  Motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of   have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor  cell using a single HSDPA device  But some mobile operators are opting for a technology called Evolution Data Optimised EV DO     US operator Sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its  network at the end of last year  We are  expanding our network and deploying EV DO technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds  said Oliver Valente Sprints vice president for technology development when the contract was announced  As part of   in multi year contracts announced late last year Sprint will spend around   on EV DO technology from Lucent Technologies Nortel Networks and Motorola that provides average data speeds of     megabits a second and peak download rates of    MMO the UK based operator with services in the UK Ireland and Germany has opted for technology based on the High Speed Downlink Packet Access HSDPA standard  Using technology from Lucent it will offer data speeds of   from next summer on its Isle of Man  network and will eventually support speeds of up to    US operator Cingular Wireless is also adopting HSDPA using technology from Lucent alongside equipment from Siemens and Ericsson     Siemens plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but Christoph Caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that   By the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in  the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of    Siemens   in collaboration with the Fraunhofer German Sino Lab for Mobile Communications and the Institute for Applied Radio System Technology   has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one  This enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band  The speeds offered by mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for  licences  But today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dial up phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of   megabits a second   must faster than   This means users are likely to find  disappointing unless the networks are souped up  If they arent those lucrative  power users  such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators  But one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately  Siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multiple antennae devices and conduct field trials  A commercial system could be as far away as  though Siemens did not rule out an earlier date

DVD copy protection strengthened    DVDs will be harder to copy thanks to new anti piracy measures devised by copy protection firm Macrovision     The pirated DVD market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago  Macrovision says its new RipGuard technology will thwart most but not all of the current DVD ripping copying programs used to pirate DVDs   RipGuard is designed to    reduce DVD ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer  said the firm  Macrovision said the new technology will work in  nearly all  current DVD players when applied to the discs but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with RipGuard  The new technology will be welcomed by Hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from DVD sales     The film industry has stepped up efforts to fight DVD piracy in the last  months taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of DVD movies for download      Ultimately we see RipGuard DVD    evolving beyond anti piracy and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions interoperability in tomorrows digital home and the upcoming high definition formats  said Steve Weinstein executive vice president and general manager of Macrovisions Entertainment Technologies Group  Macrovision said RipGuard was designed to plug the  digital hole  that was created by so called DeCSS ripper software  It circumvents Content Scrambling System measures placed on DVDs and let people make perfect digital copies of copyrighted DVDs in minutes  Those copies could then be burned onto a blank DVD or uploaded for exchange to a peer to peer network  Macrovision said RipGuard would also prevent against  rent rip and return    where people would rent a DVD copy it and then return the original  RipGuard is expected to be rolled out on DVDs from the middle of  the company said  The new system works specifically to block most ripping programs   if used those programs will now most likely crash the company said  Macrovision has said that Rip Guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti copying measures

Domain system scam fear    A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers a trade body has warned     The Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Electronic Task Force  But the UK Internet Forum UKIF is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily  The problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language     Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers says Stephen Dyer director of UKIF  Domain names are the  real language  addresses of websites rather than their internet protocol address which is a series of numbers  They are used so people can more easily navigate the web  So called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used  So for example website PayPal could now be coded using a mixture of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet  The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian a look just like an English a  But the computer code would be different and the site it would lead users to could be a fake  This is more than just a theory  A fake Paypal com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name IDN system said Mr Dyer  As the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent Mr Dyer said   Although the IDN problem is well known in technical circles the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked  said Mr Dyer      It is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site  he added  There are solutions  For instance browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users  Mr Dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the worlds browsers  Another solution to introduce IDN disabled browsers could be a case of  throwing out the baby with the bath water  he said  CENTR the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries agrees   A rush to introduce IDN disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs   a technology that is desperately needed in the non English speaking world  the organisation said in a statement

Sporting rivals go to extra time    The current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on field action without ever moving from the couch     The two giants in the field   ESPN and EA Sports   have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years  The latter is the worlds largest games manufacturer  Years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed massively entertaining and ooze flair  Sports broadcaster ESPN meanwhile has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price  But that status quo was changed forever   or for the next  years at least   by a deal earlier this year when ESPN sold EA the rights to its TV branding and on air talent meaning the ESPN games presently developed by Sega will have to come to and end in their present form     It was a massive money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters with fans concerned that it is set to enable EA to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree  Some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than  virtual signatures  Many of those clicking to complain were already rankled for the ESPN coup happened just weeks after EA had pulled off another enormous licensing deal controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from America   s National Football League NFL  So will the Sega   ESPN range be missed A key reason for answering  yes  is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste and having some options available always proves hugely handy  Online soccer fans will testify to that between bouts of arguing over which high profile title rules supreme out of the similar yet hugely different FIFA  and Pro Evolution Soccer   On the same note the ESPN  and EA sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements  Taking hockey and basketball as examples both publishers efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible  They also both look awesome with the Sega   ESPN versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front     In terms of gameplay I marginally preferred EAs NBA Live  for basketball and was more satisfied ice hockey wise by ESPNs NHL   The ESPN games are a touch more arcade like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into although like their rivals they also offer a dizzyingly extensive array of in game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die hard of sports fans  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the ESPN deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of EAs future titles  The front end decoration of EAs games has become something of an art form in itself loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music  They are also immediately identifiable as coming from the EA stable and the inevitable compulsion to add an ESPN look will no doubt change that in various ways  What is a shame is that the ESPN titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting   their preambles look and sound much like they would on TV  They are neat and excellent value games in their current form and combining them with EAs own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast

Concern over RFID tags    Consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID RFID tags in shops a survey says     More than half of  people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses  Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases  The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low  The survey of consumers in the UK France Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini  The firm works on behalf of more than  firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology  The tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner   each item contains a unique identification number     More than half   of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases  Fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that RFID tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties  Ard Jan Vetham Capgeminis principal consultant on RFID said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology   Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns   With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers the industry can reach this point   He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items  The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK   the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items  They are also in use as a passcard for the M Toll in the Midlands in the UK  Mr Vetham said the majority of people surveyed   believed that RFID tags could be read from a distance  He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology  At least once consumer group   Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering Caspian   has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing  All kinds of personal belongings including clothes could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners it warned

Digital guru floats sub   PC    Nicholas Negroponte chairman and founder of MITs Media Labs says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than          He told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries  He said one laptop per child could be   very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood   He said the child could use the laptop like a text book  He described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a Linux based operating system  We have to get the display down to below   to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel      The second trick is to get rid of the fat  if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory   The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down  Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money  In  Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age  The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on     While the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken  However Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops   We put in  laptops three years ago  only one has been broken the kids cherish these things its also a TV a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook   Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious   Nokia make  million cell phones a year so for us to claim were going to make  million laptops is a big number but were not talking about doing it in three or five years were talking about months   He plans to be distributing them by the end of  and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order   In China they spend   per child per year on textbooks  Thats for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education thats cheaper and the marketing overheads go away

Looks and music to drive mobiles    Mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts Gartner     More than  million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date  The figure was   more than in  and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions Gartner said  Good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in  said analysts  Although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to Gartner that some markets were seeing a slow down in replacement sales      All the markets grew apart from Japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western Europe  mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi told the BBC News website   Japan is where north America and western European markets can be in a couple of years time   They already have TV music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones      But there could be a slight slowdown in sales in European and US markets too according to Gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology  This means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said Gartner  Third generation mobiles  with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but Ms Milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen   At the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who dont really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical   Nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own  The majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms     More likely to drive sales in  would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services  The Motorola Razr V phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in  she added  This was not a  womens thing  she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self expression too  It was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner   Western Europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design  said Ms Milanesi      People are after something that is nice looking and together with that there is the entertainment side   This year music will have a part to play in this   The market for full track music downloads was worth just   million     million in  but is set to be worth    billion     million by  according to Jupiter Research  Sony Ericsson just released its Walkman branded mobile phone the W which combines a digital music player with up to  hours battery life and a two megapixel camera  In July last year Motorola and Apple announced a version of iTunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones  Apple said the new iTunes music player would become Motorolas standard music application for its music phones  But the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the iPod  Ms Milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives  But they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life

Kenyan school turns to handhelds    At the Mbita Point primary school in western Kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus     They are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised  It is a pilot project run by EduVision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up to date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks  Matthew Herren from EduVision told the BBC programme Go Digital how the non governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called E slates   The E slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school  This in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver  The data is transmitted alongside audio signals   The base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld E slates   It downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it  It also stores this on its hard disc      The system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network  But Mr Herren says there are both pros and cons to the project   Its very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but its also a one way connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult      The project is still at the pilot stage and EduVision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the Linux based system   The content is divided into visual information textual information and questions  Users can scroll through these sections independently of each other   EduVision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content  Mr Herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students  He is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site Google to digitise some of the worlds largest university libraries   All books in the public domain something like  million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them  Then every rural school in Africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in Oxford and Harvard  Currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity  But Mr Herren says EduVision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions   We plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the E slates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working   Maciej Sundra who designed the user interface for the E slates says the projects ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world   Why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks The fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting   as they need it most

Creator of first Apple Mac dies    Jef Raskin head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer has died     Mr Raskin was one of the first employees at Apple and made many of the design decisions that made the Mac so distinctive when it was first released  He led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking  The  release of the Mac reflected Mr Raskins belief that good design should make computers easy to use     Mr Raskin joined Apple in  as employee number  initially to lead the companys publications department  However in  he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use     The result was the  Macintosh that did away with the then common text based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents  Users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing clicking and dragging  Although now in common use in almost all computers these methods were pioneering when first used in the Macintosh  The GUI was developed by Xerox PARC and used in its Star machine  But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer   His role on the Macintosh was the initiator of the project so it wouldnt be here if it werent for him  said Andy Hertzfeld an early Macintosh team member  Although Mr Raskin drove the team that created the Macintosh he did not stay at Apple to see it released  In  he was removed from the project following a dispute with Apples mercurial boss Steve Jobs  In  Mr Raskin left Apple entirely  The Macintosh was reputedly named after Mr Raskins favourite apple though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company  After leaving Apple Mr Raskin founded another company called Information Appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers  He was also an accomplished musician played three instruments and conducted San Franciscos Chamber Opera Society  Mr Raskin was diagnosed in December  with pancreatic cancer and died on  February at his home in California

Friends fear with lost mobiles    People are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends     More than   of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years  More than half   of those asked in a poll for mobile firm Intervoice said that they do not have another address book  A fifth rely entirely on mobiles  About   of UK adults own at least one mobile according to official figures  It is estimated that   of over  own a mobile according to Intervoice but the figures are higher for those aged between  and      Most  to  year olds   and  to  year olds   own at least one  Nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts information again if the phone was lost stolen or replaced     The survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book  Many mobile owners do not bother to make back ups of their contact details and with people changing their phones once a year on average it becomes a problem  They also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart relying on the mobile phone book instead   Were a nation of lazy so and sos  David Noone from Intervoice said   We put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly cant be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book   The mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships  take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart   One in three women the survey said thought if they lost their phones it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether  Most   said they had no idea what their partners number was  Mr Noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back up services on the network itself instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves     Generally information from Sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software  Sim back up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds     But some operators offer customers free web based back up services too  Orange told the BBC News website that those with Orange Smartphones could use the My Phone syncing service which means back ups of address books and other data are created online  For non smartphone users a Memory Mate card could be used to back up data on the phone  O also offers a free web based syncing service which works over GPRS and GSM  Neither Vodafone or T Mobile currently offer a free network service for back ups but encourage people to use Sim back up devices  It is thought that about  phones are lost or stolen every month and   of total street crime involves a mobile  Mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year  Globally more than  million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of    more than the previous year according to analysts  It is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of

Games enter the classroom    Video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom     With violent titles continuing to top the charts gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn  Recent research by the London Institute of Education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom   Games teach life skills such as decision making problem solving  said Martin Owen at Futurelab  Mr Owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error     Futurelab is a non profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning  Most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but Liverpool based games firm Lateral Visions saw a gap in the market   Learning games were somewhat old fashioned and we didnt see anyone else doing what we wanted to do  said Dr Carl Gavin managing director of Lateral Visions  The company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element  The result is Racing Academy a massively multiplayer car racing game which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well     It is being used by Futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom   We are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational  said Mr Owen  Players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach  The game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs before and after racing  Teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data work collaboratively and review their own performances  This fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to Futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved thinks Mr Owen     The game has been trialled in two secondary schools in Bristol and feedback from students has been positive   Pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other  said Ben Williamson a researcher at Futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools  Dr Gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers need for learning outcomes and the childrens desire to rise to a challenge   Games in the classroom need to support the teacher  It is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge  he said  Professor Angela MacFarlane based at Bristol University has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms     Use of games in schools has been patchy she found with Sim City proving the most popular  Traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so called edu tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun she found in her research   It is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies  she wrote in a paper entitled Games and Learning  Lite versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles   persuading developers to write for the educational market  This would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing  Already there are games on the market such as Civilisation and Age of Empire that have educational elements said Mr Owen   Even in Grand Theft Auto it is not just the violence that engages people  he said  It could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though

Gadget growth fuels eco concerns    Technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi tech products     At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month several hi tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment  Ebay also announced the Rethink project bringing together Intel Apple and IBM among others to promote recycling  The US consumer electronics market is set to grow by over   in   But more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient said the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA  Of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices one of the fastest growing markets in technology  The Consumer Electronics Association CEA has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in  will reach more than    billion nearly    billion     Ebays initiative pulls together major technology firms environment groups government agencies and eBay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them  The online auction house thinks that its already established community of loyal users could be influential   We really became aware of the e waste issue and we saw that our  million users can be a powerful force for good  eBays David Stern told the BBC News website      We saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment   But it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment  Teenagers get a new mobile every  months adults every  months and a  million handsets are replaced in total each year  Yet only   are actually recycled  This year a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile according to a Deloitte report  Schemes in the US like RIPMobile could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages  The initiative which was also launched at CES rewards  to  year olds for returning unused phones   This system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games  said Seth Heine from RIPMobile     One group of students collected  mobiles for recycling in just three months  Mr Heine told the BBC News website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes  learned behaviour   Europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the US in terms of recycling awareness and robust  end of life  programmes although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too  Intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at CES which are entirely lead free      There is more and more awareness on the consumer side but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free  Intels Allen Wilson told the BBC News website   There is still low level awareness right now but it is on the rise   the highest level of awareness is in Europe   A European Union EU directive WEEE Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment comes into effect in August  It puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them  But developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances  Elements like chromium lead and cadmium   common in consumer electronics goods   will be prohibited in all products in the EU by      But it is not just about recycling either  The predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too  The biggest culprit according to the EPA is the innocuous power adaptor nicknamed  energy vampires   They provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones PDAs personal digital assistants digital cameras camcorders and digital music players     Although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget  On  January new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the European Commission Code of Conduct  But at CES the EPA also unveiled new guidelines for its latest Energy Star initiative which targets external power adapters  These map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an Energy Star logo meaning they are about   more efficient  The initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers adaptors are being brought on board  Most are made in China  About two billion are shipped global every year and about three billion are in use in the US alone  The EPA is already working with several companies which make more than   of power supplies on the market   We are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat hi tech devices but also bundle with it a hi tech efficient power supply  the EPAs Andrew Fanara said  Initiatives like this are critical  if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than   of electricity used in US homes said the EPA

Evil twin fear for wireless net    People using wireless high speed net wi fi are being warned about fake hotspots or access points     The latest threat nicknamed evil twins pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations say Cranfield University experts  Once logged onto an Evil Twin sensitive data can be intercepted  Wi fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability  London leads the global wi fi hotspots league with more than   The number of hotspots is expected to reach  by  according to analysts   Users need to be wary of using their wi fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature  said Professor Brian Collins head of information systems at Cranfield University      Users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi fi device has its security measures activated  he added  BT Openzone which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK told the BBC News website that it made every effort to make its wi fi secure   Naturally people may have security concerns  said Chris Clark chief executive for BTs wireless broadband      But wi fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet like broadband or dial up   He said BT Openzone as well as others have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot   This means that users personal information and data logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure  said Mr Clark     In the vast majority of cases base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible said Dr Nobles  Cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client  Anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin   Cybercriminals dont have to be that clever to carry out such an attack  said Dr Phil Nobles a wireless net and cybercrime expert at Cranfield   Because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency      Although wi fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high speed net on the move there have been fears over how secure it is  Some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security  A wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a companys computer system  Public wi fi hotspots offered by companies like BT Openzone and The Cloud are accessible after users sign up and pay for use  But many home and company wi fi networks are left unprotected and can be  sniffed out  and hi jacked by anyone with the correct equipment   BT advises that customers should change all default settings make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly  said Mr Clark   We also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted   Dr Nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the Science Museums Dana Centre in London on Thursday

China to overtake US net use    The Chinese net using population looks set to exceed that of the US in less than three years says a report     Chinas net users number  but this represents less than   of the countrys   billion people  Market analysts Panlogic predicts that net users in China will exceed the  million US users of the net by   The report says that the countrys culture will mean that Chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations     Already net use in China has a very different character than in many Western nations said William Makower chief executive of Panlogic  In many Western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work  By contrast in China workplace machines are relatively rare  This combined with the relatively high cost of PCs in China and the time it takes to get phone lines installed helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in China  Only   of Chinese homes have telephones according to reports   Net usage tends to happen in the evening  said Mr Makower  they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf       Its fundamentally different usage to what we have here  he said     Net use in China was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the countrys eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities  The net is key to helping Chinese people keep in touch with friends said Mr Makower  Many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes  What people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of Chinese life  For instance said Mr Makower credit cards are rare in China partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt   The most popular way to pay is Cash On Delivery  he said  and thats quite a brake to the development of e commerce   The arrival of foreign banks in China due in  could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare said Mr Makower  But if Chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on Western ways of living   A large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar  he said   Generally its more difficult for the government to be able to control it    Its real value is as an open window onto whats happening elsewhere in the world  he said  Government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages Chinese people would not see anywhere else  Familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet   Its a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it  said Mr Makower

Rich pickings for hi tech thieves    Viruses trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change     The shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash steal valuable data or take over home PCs  Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer  Instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code     The growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs  Before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines  But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package      You cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to  said Pete Simpson head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift  Now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e mail message attachments   Its about outright criminality now  said Mr Simpson explaining why this change has come about  He said many of the criminal programs came from Eastern Europe where cash rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order  Former virus writer Marek Strihavka aka Benny from the  virus writing group recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers phishing gangs and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology  No longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors  Not least said Paul King principal security consultant at Cisco because the defences against such attacks are so common   In many ways the least likely way to do it is e mail because most of us have got anti virus and firewalls now  he said  Few of the malicious programs written by hi tech thieves are cleverly written many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data   If you think of criminals they do not do clever  said Mr King  they just do what works      As the tactics used by malicious programs change said Mr King so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves  Now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network     Many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded  As well as using different tactics criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent   The main motivation now is money  said Gary Stowell spokesman for St Bernard software  Mr Stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high  With almost any phishing or spyware attack criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover  So called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites  In some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on PCs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine

Blog reading explodes in America    Americans are becoming avid blog readers with  million getting hooked in  according to new research     The survey conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project showed that blog readership has shot up by   in the last year  Some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the US presidential campaign  Despite the explosive growth more than   of online Americans have still never heard of blogs the survey found  Blogs or web logs are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts opinions or spread news events in their own words  Companies such as Google and Microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs     The rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information with six million Americans now using RSS aggregators  RSS aggregators are downloaded to PCs and are programmed to subscribe to feeds from blogs news sites and other websites  The aggregators automatically compile the latest information published online from the blogs or news sites  Reading blogs remains far more popular than writing them the survey found  Only   of the  million US adults who use the internet had created a blog or web based diary  Getting involved is becoming more popular though with   saying they had posted material or comments on other peoples blogs     Just under one in  of the USs internet users read political blogs such as the Daily Kos or Instapundit during the US presidential campaign  Kerry voters were slightly more likely to read them than Bush voters  Blog creators were likely to be young well educated net savvy males with good incomes and college educations the survey found  This was also true of the average blog reader although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities  The survey was conducted during November and involved telephone surveys of  internet users

New delay hits EU software laws    A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer based inventions     The draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed  The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months  Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open source software innovation   There was at one point the intention to put the item on todays agenda  But in the end we could not put it on  an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency  He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law     In December Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software  Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting  Poland is a large EU member so its backing for the legislation is vital  The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters  In the US the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted  This means that the US based Amazon com holds a patent for its  one click shopping  service  Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies  But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing

Savvy searchers fail to spot ads    Internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits     The report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that   of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine  It also shows that few can spot the difference between paid for results and organic ones  The report reveals that   of net users say they regularly use Google Ask Jeeves MSN and Yahoo when online     Almost   of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden  According to figures gathered by the Pew researchers the average users spends about  minutes per month carrying out  separate searches and looks at   webpages for each hunt  A significant chunk of net users   carry out a search at least weekly and   of those asked only look every few weeks  For   of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find     Search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it  According to Pew Research   of searchers use just a single search engine   use two or three and a small number   consult more than three sites  Tony Macklin spokesman for Ask Jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query  Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes  A small number   said they wouldnt really miss search engines if they did not exist  The remaining   said they could not live without search sites  More than two thirds of those questioned   said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net  Alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web  Of those asked   were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search  Only   of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not  Said the Pew report   This finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results   Commenting Mr Macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference

Games firms face tough future    UK video game firms face a testing time as they prepare for the next round of games consoles the industry warns     Fred Hasson head of Tiga which represents independent developers said that more UK firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles  Three leading UK video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as they struggled to adapt  Microsoft Sony and Nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next  months  Microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that Xbox  will be released in the US before the end of      The new machines will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games  Mr Hasson said   In the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers   He said there were about  independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close   Once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities  he said     Mr Hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines  That figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the BBC News website   Codemasters Climax and Rebellion      As consoles get more powerful the content gets more detailed and that means more cost  said Gary Dunn development director at Codemasters which develops games in house and also publishes titles  Jason Kingsley chief executive of Rebellion said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because  the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger   He added   We have been through five technology transitions and survived so far   Each one has involved the death of some people  All companies said they were investing in new tools   called middleware   in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control     Simon Gardner president of Climaxs Action studio said   We are investing in superior tools and editors  We are investing upfront to generate this content without the need for huge teams   Its vital we avoid huge teams   He said Climax was already directing about   of its resources to preparation for next generation titles  Mr Dunn warned that companies could face a short supply of programming development and artistic talent   If companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams at some point the talent is going to run out   Mr Hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more  business like    There are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days   Some of them are still making games for peer group approval   that has to stop

Smart search lets art fans browse    If you dont know art but know what you like new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting     ArtGarden developed by BTs research unit is being tested by the Tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings  Rather than search by the name of an artist or painting users are shown a selection of pictures  Clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works     The technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection  It chooses a selection of pictures by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them  So for instance a Whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and Whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement  century and water  A variety of paintings will then be shown to the user based partly on the keywords and partly on luck   It is much more akin to wandering through the gallery  said Jemima Rellie head of the Tates digital programme  For Richard Tateson who worked on the ArtGarden project the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration   I went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for Christmas but I didnt have a clue what I wanted  he said  The text based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer neither of which he found helpful  He ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead     He thinks the dominance of text based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers  Similarly with art browsing is often more important than finding a particular object   You dont arrive at Tate Britain and tell people what you want to see  One of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldnt have asked for  he said  The Tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as ArtGarden can help with that said Ms Rellie  She hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future  BT research is looking at extending the technology to other searching such as for music and films

Warning over Windows Word files    Writing a Microsoft Word document can be a dangerous business according to document security firm Workshare     Up to   of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed a survey by the firm revealed  To make matters worse   of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking  The report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding     Sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers said Andrew Pearson European boss of Workshare which commissioned the research   The efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too  he said  The problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using Microsoft Word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes  As documents get passed around worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents  Poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits  Microsoft however does provide an add on tool for Windows PCs that fixes the problem   The Remove Hidden Data add in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your Microsoft Office application  says the instructions on Microsofts website  Microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any Word document  A tool for Apple machines running Word is not available  Workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that on average   of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three quarters fell in to the high risk category  Often said Mr Pearson this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared     However the way that Windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved  Few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed  The discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if for instance those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated  The research revealed that a documents metadata could be substantial as on average only   of contributors changes to a document make it to the final draft  Problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite said Mr Pearson

Net regulation still possible    The blurring of boundaries between TV and the internet raises questions of regulation watchdog Ofcom has said     Content on TV and the internet is set to move closer this year as TV quality video online becomes a norm  At a debate in Westminster the net industry considered the options  Lord Currie chairman of super regulator Ofcom told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog  Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option  At the debate organised by the Internet Service Providers Association ISPA Lord Currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation      The challenge will arise when boundaries between TV and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves  he said  Adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate TV content or self regulation which is currently the practice of the net industry will be up for discussion     Some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of  and the technology opens the door to TV content delivered over the net  More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web  BT has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB ITV and the BBC  Head of the division Andrew Burke spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms   How risque can I be in this new age With celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners surely I can push it to the limit  he said     In fact he said if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it then maybe it should be entirely regulation free  Internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the Law Commission dubbed them  mere conduits  back in   This defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it  The level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high profile legal cases  Richard Ayers portal director at Tiscali said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible  Huge changes are afoot in  he predicted as companies such as the BBC offer TV content over the net  The BBCs planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as EastEnders and Top Gear will make net TV mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions he said     One of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee said Mr Ayers  As inappropriate net content most obviously pornography viewed by children continues to dominate the headlines internet regulation remains a political issue said MP Richard Allan Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT  Mr Allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of  impossible to regulate  and  just apply offline laws online   In fact instead of seeing regulation brought online the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all TV content  After Lord Currie departed the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign   If content is on demand consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them then it is the consumers choice to watch it  There is no watershed on the net  said Mr Burke

The future in your pocket    If you are a geek or gadget fan the next  months look like they are going to be a lot of fun     The relentless pace of development in the hi tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors particularly among mobile phone firms all suggests that  is going to be a very good year  To begin with  will be the year that third generation  mobile phones become inescapable  The  network launched in  Vodafone launched its consumer service in November Orange followed in early December and T Mobile and O are due to launch in   The main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up     Already the extra capacity in  networks lets  offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators  But the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue   Show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them and Ill write their obituary  said Niel Ransom chief technology officer at Alcatel     Instead operators are likely to push all other things that  phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities  Already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi megapixel devices go on sale  But  will not have everything its own way  It will face competition from emerging technologies such as Wimax  This wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to  megabits per second and works over distances of up to  miles  Kent is likely to be the site of the UKs first Wimax network which is due to go live in  and it could be the way that rural areas get high speed net access  Analyst firm Telecom View predicts that Wimax will steal a lot of market share from  and will be a clear winner  Bob Larribeau principal analyst at Telecom View said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as Wimax could dent the possible returns of  networks  And the growing ubiquity of wi fi must not be forgotten either  The technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers     Moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in  too     For a start BT looks set to roll out its Bluephone project during the next  months  The service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home  Fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP Voip  Voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network  Anyone with a broadband connection which is now more than   of the UKs net using population can use Voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it  Telecommunications regulator Ofcom has declared  to be the area code for Voip calls and  is likely to see a lot more consumer focused Voip call services starting up  Home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition  If  has been the year of the portable music player they  looks like it will be the year of the portable media player  Motorola has just announced a deal with Apple to produce a phone that works with the iTunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace  The pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet  Some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had  Convergence could mean that single function devices start to dwindle in number  Instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want  The only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities  But that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with

What high definition will do to DVDs    First it was the humble home video then it was the DVD and now Hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment   high definition     High definition gives incredible  like pictures and surround sound  The DVD disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out  But when high definition films do come out on the new format DVDs it will profoundly change home entertainment  For Rick Dean director of business development for digital content company THX a high definition future is an exciting prospect  He has worked on the Star Wars DVD trilogy Finding Nemo The Incredibles and Indiana Jones   There was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds  he told the BBC News website      The technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined   The film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master  he says  But currently putting a master feature film onto DVD requires severe compression because current DVD technology cannot hold as much as high definition films demand   As much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master  he explains   I would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high def world and I find it very exciting      High definition DVDs can hold up to six times more data than the DVDs we are used to  It will take time though to persuade people who spent money on DVD players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high definition DVDs in  months time  Mr Dean is confident though   I think if they see real HD  high definition  not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference   I have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen      High definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too  On the whole producing films for high definition DVDs will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed  Equally it may mean Hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average DVD   When we master movies right now our data rates are running at about   gigabits per second  says Mr Dean   Our DVDs that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second   Thats a huge amount of compression that has to be applied   about    So if you have anything that allows more space you dont have to compress so hard   Studios could fit a lot more marketing material games and features onto high capacity DVDs  Currently an entire DVD project can take up to three months says Mr Dean  Although the step of down converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save a days work says Mr Dean  One of the most time consuming elements is building DVD navigation and menu systems  On the fairly complex Star Wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took  human hours alone  If studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay   If the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required   And if studios do focus on delivering more  added value content  thinks Mr Dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it  Those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high definition DVD  But if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price studios will listen thinks Mr Dean     High definition throws up other challenge to film makers and DVD production alike  More clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous   When we did the first HD version of Star Wars Episode I everybody was very sun tanned but that was make up   In the HD version of Episode I all these make up lines showed up  explains Mr Dean  The restoration of the older Star Wars episodes revealed some interesting items too      There are scans of a corridor  on the Death Star  and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways   You never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didnt see it   What high definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur  With home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further  It could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen   In the future we are going to look towards file delivery over IP  internet protocol   broadband  giving a DVD like experience from the set top box to the hard drive  says Mr Dean  But that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves

Mobile games come of age    The BBC News website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing  A brief round up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below     If you think of Snake when some mentions  mobile games  then you could be in for a bit of a surprise  This is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time  Even before Nokias N Gage game phone launched in late  many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset     And given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the GameBoy it could be a very lucrative market  That audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can  Life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed  Now sites such as Wireless Gaming Review list more than  different titles for some UK networks and the ranges suit every possible taste  There are ports of PC and arcade classics such as Space Invaders Lunar Lander and Bejewelled  There are also versions of titles such as Colin McRae Rally that you typically find on PCs and consoles     There are shoot em ups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets  Rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie in  Increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads  The returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost     What has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as Wap push  By sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset  Far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals  The number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too  Almost half of all phones now have Java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available   even the ones that use  graphics     The minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too  Now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option  The processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too  Some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile  Many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others  Usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a  ghost  or  shadow  to see if you can beat them  A few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via Bluetooth short range radio technology  With so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening  But these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing      TOO FAST TOO FURIOUS DIGITAL BRIDGES     As soon as I start playing this I remember why I never play driving games   because Im rubbish at them  No matter if I drive the car via joystick or keypad I just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers  The game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit  Winning gives you cash for upgrades  Graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background  The cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track  The only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play      FATAL FORCE MACROSPACE     A futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading Earth  Graphics are a bit cartoon like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring  Both background music and sounds effects work well  The scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the Fatal Force commanders  Weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while  With the right power up you can go into a Matrix style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens  The game lets you play via Bluetooth if others are in range  Online the game has quite a following with clans player rankings and even new downloadable maps

California sets fines for spyware    The makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home PCs could face hefty fines in California     From  January a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware  The legislation which was approved by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information  Spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing PC users in the coming year  The software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information  At its worst it has the ability to hijack personal data like passwords login details and credit card numbers  The programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate     One form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer users web surfing  It can result in people being bombarded with pop up ads that are hard to close  In Washington Congress has been debating four anti spyware bills but California is a step ahead  The states Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer  It also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware  Consumers are able to seek up to   in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software  The new law marks a continuing trend in California towards tougher privacy rights  A recent survey by Earthlink and Webroot found that   of PCs are infested with the surreptitious software and that on average each one is harbouring  separate spyware programs  Currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as Spybot and Ad Aware

Web helps collect aid donations    The web is helping aid agencies gather resources to help cope with the aftermath of the tsunami disaster     Many people are making donations via websites or going online to see how they can get involved with aid efforts  High profile web portals such as Google Yahoo Ebay and Amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations  So many were visiting some aid related sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic  An umbrella organisation called the Disasters Emergency Committee DEC has been set up by a coalition of  charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website  It urged people to go online where possible to help because donations could be processed more quickly than cash donated in other ways meaning aid could be delivered as quickly as possible  The site has so far received almost    million with more than  donations being made online every hour     Telco BT stepped in to take over the secure payments on the DEC site and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after it was initially crippled with online donations  It has also provided space in Londons BT tower for one of the call centres dealing with donations     Some of the webs biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying their homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources  On its famously sparse homepage Google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made  Among the  organisations listed are Oxfam Medecins sans Frontieres Doctors Without Borders and Network for Good  Many of the sites that Google lists are also taking online donations  Online retailer Amazon has put a large message on its start page that lets people donate money directly to the American Red Cross that will be used with relief efforts  Auction site eBay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on eBay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list  Yahoo is proving links direct to charities for those that want to donate  The Auction Drop website is asking people to donate old digital cameras computers and other gadgets they no longer want that can be auction to raise cash for the aid effort  Sadly the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in  Anti fraud organisations are warning about e mails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies  Those wanting to give cash were urged to use legitimate websites of charities and aid agencies

Mobiles rack up  years of use    Mobile phones in the UK are celebrating their  anniversary this weekend     Britains first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on  January  by veteran comedian Ernie Wise  In the  years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost   of Britons own a handset  Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline     The first ever call over a portable phone was made in  in New York but it took  years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched  The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in  that let people make calls while they walked  The first call was made from St Katherines dock to Vodafones head office in Newbury which at the time was over a curry house  For the first nine days of  Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK  Then on  January Cellnet now O launched its service  Mike Caudwell spokesman for Vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about    and had a battery life of little more than  minutes      Despite that they were hugely popular in the mid   he said   They became a yuppy must have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk   This was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on  He said it took Vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only  months to get the second million   Its very easy to forget that in  when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people  he said   Cellnet was forecasting half that   Now Vodafone has  customers in the UK alone  Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until  when One now T Mobile was launched  Orange had its UK launch in   Both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology  The analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired  Called Global System for Mobiles GSM this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than   billion people make calls  Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular

Blogs take on the mainstream    Web logs or blogs are everywhere with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow     These online diaries come in many shapes and styles ranging from people willing to sharing their views pictures and links to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers  But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye witness account of events  Most blogs may have only a small readership but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics  The most well known examples include Iraqi Salam Paxs accounts of the US led war former Iranian vice president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republics government and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign  There are already websites pulling together these first hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs like wikinews com launched last November     The blogging movement has been building up for many years     Andrew Nachison Director of the Media Center a US based think tank that studies media technology and society highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs   You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before  he says   And blogs were a key part of that transformation   Among them were blogs carrying picture messages saying  we are sorry  for George W Bushs victory and the responses from his supporters  Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers TV and radio   We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas  he told the BBC News website   But they followed the story they didnt lead it      Some parts of the so called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs     Others like the French newspaper Le Monde have applied a different strategy offering blogs as part of its content   I dont think the mission and role of journalism is threatened  It is in transition as society itself is in transition  says Mr Nachison  However he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper   The one to many road of traditional journalism yes it is threatened  And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse  says Mr Nachison   The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides whats acceptable for public consumption and what isnt thats gone forever    With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets like camera or video phones we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories      It seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger     But the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing in a web already overloaded with information  Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence the so called blogosphere has already exceeded five million and is growing at exponential levels  Tools such as Googles Blogger MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog  US research think tank Pew Internet   American Life says a blog is created every   seconds although less than   of the total are updated at least once every two months  But experts agree that the phenomenon allowing individuals to publish share ideas exchange information comment on current issues post images or video on the web easily is here to stay   We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other  said Mr Nachison   And theres going to be bad that comes with the good

Bush website blocked outside US    Surfers outside the US have been unable to visit the official re election site of President George W Bush     The blocking of browsers sited outside the US began in the early hours of Monday morning  Since then people outside the US trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it  The blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers but as a result of a policy decision by the Bush camp     The international exclusion zone around georgewbush com was spotted by net monitoring firm Netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites  Netcraft said that since the early hours of  October attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in London Amsterdam and Sydney failed     By contrast Netcrafts four monitoring stations in the US managed to view the site with no problems  The site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the US  Some web users in Canada also report that they can browse the site  The pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers  Geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis  On  October the George W Bush website began using the services of a company called Akamai to ensure that the pages videos and other content on its site reaches visitors  Mike Prettejohn president of Netcraft speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run up to the election on  November  He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week  Managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign  However simply blocking non US visitors also means that Americans overseas are barred too  Akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites

Blogger grounded by her airline    A US airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog or online diary     Queen of the Sky otherwise known as Ellen Simonetti evolved into an anonymous semi fictional account of life in the sky  But after she posted pictures of herself in uniform Delta Airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay  Ms Simonetti was told her suspension was a result of  inappropriate  images  Delta Airlines declined to comment      I was really shocked I had no warning  Ms Simonetti told BBC News Online   I never thought I would get in trouble because of the blog  I thought if they had a problem someone would have said something before taking action   The issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest employment law and free speech on personal websites  Ms Simonetti was suspended on  September pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC  A spokesperson for Delta Airlines told BBC News Online   All I can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media   She added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past     Ms Simonetti started her personal blog in January to help her get over her mothers death  She had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for and created fictional names for cities and companies  The airlines name was changed to Anonymous Airline and the city in which she was based was called Quirksville  A large part of the blog contained fictional stories because Queen of the Sky developed over the months as a character in her own right according to Ms Simonetti     The images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother   We often take pictures on flight or on layovers  I just though why not include them on my blog for fun   I never meant it as something to harm my company and dont understand how they think it did harm them  Ms Simonetti said  She has also claimed that pictures of male Delta Airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web  Of the  or so images on the site only one showed Ms Simonettis flight  wings    They did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with  I am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up  she said  The images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended  As far as Ms Simonetti knows there is no company anti blogging policy  There is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear     Jeffrey Matsuura director of the law and technology programme at the University of Dayton said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees   There are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers  he said  It was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly was reasonable and enforced fairly in company policy   You have to remember that as an employee you dont have total free speech anymore  he said  Mr Matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog   One of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them but they may not be particularly clear when they  employees  do cross the line   He speculated that Delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of Ms Simonetti in uniform were posted   Whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line  he said  Ms Simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs  One of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken   If they had asked me just take down the blog I would have done it but that was not been given to me as an option  she said   This blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it  If I had known it would cost me my job I would not have done that

Camera phones are must haves    Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of  than last year says a report from analysts Gartner     Globally the number sold will reach  million an increase of    The report predicts that nearly   of all mobile phones sold will have a built in camera by   Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly  must have  buy  In Europe cameras on mobiles can take   megapixel images  But in Japan and Asia Pacific where camera phone technology is much more advanced mobiles have already been released which can take   megapixel images  Japan still dominates mobile phone technology and the uptake there is huge  By  according to Gartner   of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them     Camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS Multimedia Messaging Services  This has changed in the last  months  Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use  Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways they have introduced more design features like rotating screens and viewfinders removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages     Mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people  These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites or mobile blogs   moblogs  But the report suggests that until image quality increases more people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks  Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving  The Gartner report suggests that by mid  it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels  Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality and up to six megapixels on a high end camera  But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras  Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly lit conditions like nightclubs  Other developments include wide angle modes basic editing features and better sensors and processors for recording film clips     Images from camera phones have even made it into the art world  An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists     The exhibition Fonetography will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey Rankin and Nan Goldin and artists Sir Peter Blake Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano  But some uses for them have worried many organisations  Intel Samsung the UKs Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked  Many schools fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse  Italys information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used  But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers profits  According to recent figures Sony Ericssons profits tripled in the third quarter because of new camera phones  Over   of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras it said

Games deserve a place in class    Computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom say researchers     Academics from the Institute of Education at London University found that  games literacy  was a key skill for youngsters  As well as being used in different areas of the curriculum games are a legitimate area of study in their own right researchers say  Pupils should also be able to create their own games they say      Like all games computer and video games entertain while promoting social development and playing and talking about games is an important part of young peoples lives  said project manager Caroline Pelletier      Games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation just like writing or drawing  she said  The researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning  Researchers found that girls were often excluded from the male dominated world of game playing   Without first hand experience of how much fun a game can be they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity  said research fellow Diane Carr     The second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them  Sixth form teacher Barney Oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film TV and popular music at the A level course he runs at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge     For parents the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment could cause controversy  Dr Andrew Burn associate director of the Institute of Educations Centre for the Study of Children Youth and Media moved to reassure anxious parents   Games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film television and literature do  he said   But we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games   The games industry welcomed the report saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children   At a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently  said Roger Bennett director general of the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association   This report is further evidence if it were needed about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming  They have much to offer to the education of our children and they have much to offer as a career   The three year research project which is being presented at a seminar on Tuesday in London was partly funded by the Department of Trade and Industry

Nuclear body seeks new tech    The computer systems used to monitor the worlds nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors     A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than  years old  Such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide  The agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software   A major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate secure online access to information  said project manager Livio Costantini     IAEA inspectors make around  visits a year to more than  nuclear facilities worldwide  They are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants to carry out environmental checks and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility     The computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits for instance was built in the  and largely paper based  An IAEA spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack  The organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in November aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data design blueprints of nuclear facilities even satellite images of the plant  Where possible it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials  Further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries according to a spokesman     Computer specialist at the IAEA Peter Smith would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques more familiar to video games players into the inspectors toolkit   The commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world  he said   If we could have that on our laptops we could be walking through the plant seeing on the laptop how the plant should look   And if theres a door in the wall that is not on our laptop then we have a problem   The IAEA estimates the total cost of the four year project to upgrade its technology will be    So far it has only received   from the US and the UK   Failure to replace the hardware and software and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks  said an agency statement

Search wars hit desktop PCs    Another front in the on going battle between Microsoft and Google is about to be opened     By the end of  Microsoft aims to launch search software to find any kind of file on a PC hard drive  The move is in answer to Googles release of its own search tool that catalogues data on desktop PCs  The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as Google AOL Yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files     Microsoft made the announcement about its forthcoming search software during a call to financial analysts to talk about its first quarter results  John Connors Microsofts chief financial officer said a test version of its desktop search software should be available for download by the end of the year      Were going to have a heck of a great race in search between Google Microsoft and Yahoo  he said   Its going to be really fun to follow   Microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users  The program could be based on the software Microsoft owns as a result of its purchase of Lookout Software in early October  On  October Google released desktop search software that catalogues all the files on a PC and lets users use one tool to find e mail messages spreadsheets text files and presentations  The software will also find webpages and messages sent via AOL Instant Messenger     Many other firms have released desktop search systems recently too  Companies such as Blinkx Copernic Enfish X Technologies and X Friend all do the same job of cataloguing the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer     Apple has also debuted a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to debut with the release of the Tiger operating system  Due to follow are net giants AOL and Yahoo  The latter recently bought Stata Labs to get its hands on search software that people can use  Microsoft is also reputedly working on a novel search system for the next version of Windows codenamed Longhorn  However this is not likely to appear until    The recent activity in the search industry shows that there is a need to move beyond simple keyword based web search  said Kathy Rittweger co founder of Blinkx   Finding information of our own computers is becoming as difficult as it is to find the relevant webpage amongst the billions that exist      Desktop search has become important for several reasons  According to research by message analysts the Radicati Group up to   of the information critical to keeping many businesses running sits in e mail messages and attachments  JF Sullivan spokesman for e mail software firm Sendmail said many organisations were starting to realise how important messaging was to their organisation and the way the work   The key thing is being able to manage all this information  he said  Also search is increasingly key to the way that people get around the internet  Many people use a search engine as the first page they go to when getting on the net  Many others use desktop toolbars that let them search for information no matter what other program they are using  Having a tool on a desktop can be a lucrative way to control where people go online  For companies such as Google which relies on revenue from adverts this knowledge about what people are looking for is worth huge amounts of money  But this invasiveness has already led some to ask about the privacy implications of such tools

Home phones face unclear future    The fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species     Research by handset maker Nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take  According to the study more than  million people in the UK Germany US and South Korea now only use a mobile  It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile     The Nokia sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes  Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter between mobiles and to friends  In the UK   of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile  However when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared  In the US and Germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds  In all the countries where interviews were carried out older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile  Women aged  or above almost never use a mobile phone the research found     The move to mobile was most pronounced in South Korea where   of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile    said they would not get a landline if they moved house     Many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the  cosiness  of making a call there  Nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap reliable and providing good call quality  The survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless  Some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years  Polling firm Mori interviewed more than  people in the UK US Germany and South Korea for the survey

Podcasts mark rise of DIY radio    An Apple iPod or other digital music players can hold anything up to  songs which is a lot of space to fill     But more and more iPod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers  It is called  podcasting  and its strongest proponent is former MTV host and VJ video jockey Adam Curry  Podcasting takes its name from the Apple iPod although you do not need an iPod to create one or to listen to a podcast  A podcast is basically an internet based radio show which podcasters create usually in the comfort of their own home  They need only a microphone a PC and some editing software  They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them all for free  Using technology based on XML computer code and RSS   Really Simple Syndication   listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software which Mr Curry has pioneered  The latest MP files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically     Mr Curry records hosts edits and produce a daily  minute podcast called The Daily Source Code  He wants to make podcasting  the Next Big Thing  and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry   I was always into technologies and wires  he explains   My parents gave me the Radio Shack  project kit which allows you to build an AM transmitter and subsequently an FM transmitter   I had my mom drive me around the block see how far it would reach on the car radio      Mr Curry is American but he grew up in the Netherlands where he hosted illegal pirate radio shows in the Dutch capital  He tried university in the US and ended up back in Holland where he hosted a music video show  He spent the next seven years in New York where he worked at MTV hosting the Top  Video Countdown but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet   At a certain point in  I was driving in on a Friday afternoon beautiful blue sky one of those beautiful days thinking this is so stupid   You know Im going do the Top  Countdown take the cheque go home and sit on the internet until three in the morning   So after I finished the show I quit  I said on air its been great Ive been here for seven years at that point theres something on the internet Ive got to go find it and Ill see you later      But Mr Currys technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high speed internet connections were becoming more widely available  The MP format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before     Most importantly Mr Curry says people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing   Listen to   of the radio that you hear today its radio voices and its fake its just fake   He wanted to make it easier for people to find  real voices  on the internet  He wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like iPods  Mr Curry is not a computer programmer so he asked others to create one for him  No one did so he tried to write one himself  He finished it a few months ago and says it  totally sucked   He put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it  the result is a work in progress called  ipodder   Doug Kaye a California based podcaster praises the former MTV VJ for what he has done   Adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem  Ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the MP player  he explains   People can wake up in the morning pick up their iPods as they go to work or before they go exercise and discover that theres all this new content automatically put onto their players   It is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in Australia Finland Brazil even Malaysia  One couple broadcasts theirs The Dawn and Drew Show from Wisconsin in the US sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed  Topics range from the comfort of their bed to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners     Already websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts     Chris McIntyre runs Podcast Alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know how to simply listen   If I were to tell my mom or my mother in law to copy an XML or RSS file to their podcast aggregator they would think I was speaking a foreign language  Mr McIntyre says  Along with technical challenges there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite albeit copyrighted music  Some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the  anti radio  into something that is more like conventional broadcasting  Already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world  Heineken is doing its own podcast now and so is Playboy  For his part Adam Currys pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be  He loves doing The Daily Source Code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences  He has even been called the Ed Sullivan or Johnny Carson of podcasting which he says  is a badge Ill wear with great honour   To be the Johnny Carson or Ed Sullivan of anything is wonderful  And you know what You dont need a hell of a lot of talent   You just have to be nice have your ears open and let people shine  And thats good for me      Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World a BBC World Service and WGBH Boston co production

Games maker fights for survival    One of Britains largest independent game makers Argonaut Games has been put up for sale     The London based company behind the Harry Potter games has sacked about  employees due to a severe cash crisis  The administrators told BBC News Online that selling Argonaut was the only way to save it as it had run out of cash  Argonaut warned that it was low on cash  days ago when its shares were suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange     Argonaut has been making games for some  years and is one the largest independent games developers in the UK     Along with its headquarters in north London it operates studios in Cambridge and Sheffield  Argonaut was behind the Harry Potter games which provided a healthy flow of cash into the company  But like all software developers Argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers  Signs that it was in trouble emerged in August when it warned it was heading for losses of    in the financial year due to delays in signing new contracts for games  Those new deals were further delayed leading Argonaut to warn in mid October that it was running out of cash and suspend trading of its shares on the London Stock Exchange  As part of cost cutting measures some  employees were fired   When the news about the    loss came out we knew there were going to be redundancies  said Jason Parkinson one of the game developers sacked by Argonaut   A lot of people suspected that Argonaut had been in trouble for some time  he told BBC News Online  Mr Parkinson said staff were told the job losses were necessary to save Argonaut from going under  At the start of the year the company employed  people  After the latest round of cuts there are  staff at Argonaut headquarters in Edgware in north London with  at its Morpheme offices in Kentish Town London and  at the Just Add Monsters base in Cambridge     Argonaut called in administrators David Rubin   Partners on Friday to find a way to rescue the company from collapse  It spent the weekend going over the companys finances and concluded that the only way to save the business was to put it up for sale  The administrator told BBC News Online that the costs of restructuing would be too high partly because of the overheads from the companys four premises across the UK  It said it was hopeful that it could save some  jobs by selling the business saying it had had expressions of interest from several quarters and were looking for a quick sale  The administrator said it would ensure that staff made redundant would receive any wages redundancy or holiday pay due to them hopefully by Christmas

Pompeii gets digital make over    The old fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer generated images that bring the site to life     A European Union funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer augmented versions of archaeological attractions  It would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as Pompeii  It could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism     The technology would allow digital people and other computer generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site     The Lifeplus project is part of the EUs Information Society Technologies initiative aimed at promoting user friendly technology and enhancing European cultural heritage  Engineers and researchers working in the Europe wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented reality system  It would require the visitor to wear a head mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer  The camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitors viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements  At Pompeii for example the visitor would not just see the frescos taverns and villas that have been excavated but also people going about their daily life  Augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as Troy and Lord of the Rings and in computer gaming      This technology can now be used for much more than just computer games  said Professor Nadia Magnenat Thalman of the Swiss research group MiraLab      We are for the first time able to run this combination of software processes to create walking talking people with believable clothing skin and hair in real time  she said  Unlike virtual reality which delivers an entirely computer generated scene to the viewer the Lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views  Crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitors view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements  The software capable of doing this has been developed by a UK company   Andrew Stoddart chief scientist at  said that the EU project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life   The popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computer generated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life  he said

Fast moving phone bugs appear    Security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs     The new strains of the Cabir mobile phone virus use short range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range  The Cabir virus only affects high end handsets running the Symbian Series  phone operating system  Despite the warnings there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of Cabir     The original Cabir worm came to light in mid June  when it was sent to anti virus firms as a proof of concept program  A mistake in the way the original Cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time     However the new Cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range Bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range  Bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres  The risk of being infected by Cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it  Users can protect themselves by altering a setting on Symbian phones that conceals the handset from other Bluetooth using devices  Finnish security firm F Secure issued a warning about the new strains of Cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone  All they do is block normal Bluetooth activity and drain the phones battery  Anti virus firm Sophos said the source code for Cabir had been posted on the net by a Brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created  So far seven versions of Cabir are know to exist one of which was inside the malicious Skulls program that was found in late November  Symbians Series  software is licenced by Nokia LG Electronics Lenovo Panasonic Samsung Sendo and Siemens

Concerns over Windows ATMs    Cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses a security firm has warned     The warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the Windows operating system in machines  Already there have been four incidents in which Windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the Microsoft operating system  But banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small     For many years the venerable IBM operating system known as OS  has been the staple software used to power many of the   cash machines in operation around the world  But IBM will end support for OS  in  which is forcing banks to look for alternatives  There are also other pressures making banks turn to Windows said Dominic Hirsch managing director of financial analysis firm Retail Banking Research     He said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new Europay Mastercard and Visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data  US laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways  Todd Thiemann spokesman for anti virus firm Trend Micro said the move to Windows in cash machines was not without risks  Mr Thiemann said research by the TowerGroup showed that   of new cash machines being installed were Windows based     Already he said there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them     In January  the Slammer worm knocked out  cash machines of the Bank of America and many of those operated by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  In August of the same year cash machines of two un named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the Welchia worm  Incidents like this happen said Mr Thiemann because when banks start using Windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers  This often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network   This could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system  he said   Banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network  Mr Thiemann told BBC News Online     But Mr Hirsch from Retail Banking Research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year     Currently he said a cash machine has a lifetime of up to  years which means that only about   of all ATMs get swapped for a newer model every year   Windows cash machines have been around for several years  he said   Most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle    In theory there is a bigger threat with Windows than OS   he said  but I do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment    Its pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with ATMs  he said  The many different security systems built in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously he said  Banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all he added  A spokesman for the Association of Payment and Clearing Services Apacs which represents the UKs payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal   Theres no concern that theres going to be any type of virus hitting the UK networks  he said  Risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect UK cash machines together and the operators of the ATMs themselves were a much smaller and tightly knit community than in the US where viruses have struck

Attack prompts Bush site block    The official re election site of President George W Bush is blocking visits from overseas users for  security reasons      The blocking began early on Monday so those outside the US and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it  But keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective  Many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses     The policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush com website  Scott Stanzel a spokesman for the Bush Cheney campaign said   The measure was taken for security reasons   He declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy  The barring of non US visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place  In early October a so called  denial of service  attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of PCs  The attack made the site unusable for about five hours     About the same time the web team of the Bush Cheney campaign started using the services of a company called Akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic  Akamai uses a web based tool called EdgeScape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based  Typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic  Geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis  Readers of the Boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the George W Bush domain name  Ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site  There are now at least three working alternative domains for the Bush Cheney campaign that let web users outside the US visit the site  The site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the US  Some web users in Canada also report that they can browse the site     The international exclusion zone around georgewbush com was spotted by net monitoring firm Netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites     Netcraft said that since the early hours of  October attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in London Amsterdam and Sydney have failed  By contrast Netcrafts four monitoring stations in the US managed to view the site with no problems  Data gathered by Netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack  Mike Prettejohn Netcraft president speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run up to the election on  November  He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week  Managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign  However simply blocking non US visitors also means that Americans overseas are barred too  Most American soldiers stationed overseas will be able to see the site as they use the US militarys own portion of the net  Akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites

The Force is strong in Battlefront    The warm reception that has greeted Star Wars  Battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay but of its back to basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient     Geared towards online gamers it is based around little more than a series of all out gunfights set in an array of locations all featured in or hinted at during the two blockbusting film trilogies  Previous Star Wars titles like the acclaimed Knights Of The Old Republic and Jedi Knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchises extensive universe and their use of weird and wonderful new characters  Battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves     The sights sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans who may well feel that the opportunity to relive Star Wars most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for  The mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first person perspective and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join Darth Vader on the Dark Side depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the players personal propensity for good or evil     There is ample chance to be a Wookie shoot Ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired up Luke Skywalker  In each section the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet  It really is no more complicated than that  Locations include the frozen wastes of Hoth the ice planet from The Empire Strikes Back complete with massive mechanical AT ATs on the march  There are also the dusty sinister deserts of Tatooine and Geonosis as well as the forest moon of Endor where Return Of The Jedis much maligned Ewoks lived  The feel of those places is well and truly captured with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic  It is worth noting though that on the PlayStation  the games graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the Xbox version  The pivotal element behind Battlefronts success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large scale war  The number of combatants noise and abundance of laser fire see to that and the sense of chaos really comes over     Speaking of noise Battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the Star Wars galaxys audio motifs     The multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar as are the stirring John Williams symphonies that never let up  There is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section  It has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being Star Wars it would not stand up for long  The gameplay is reliable bog standard stuff short on originality  There are also odd annoyances like the games insistence on re spawning you miles away from the action an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear  And some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be  That said it is still great fun to pilot a Scout Walker or Speeder Bike however non user friendly they prove  Whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind Battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game  The above average AI of the enemy sees to that although given the frenetic environments they operate in their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated  Battlefronts novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast leaving behind a slightly empty one trick pony of a game  But for a while it is an absolute blast and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from George Lucas stable

GTA sequel is criminally good    The Grand Theft Auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition     The  certificate GTA  San Andreas for the PlayStation  could have got away with merely revisiting a best selling formula with a more of the same approach  Instead it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps carefree over all the Driv and True Crime shaped opposition  Even in the year that will see sequels to Halo and Half Life it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic     The basic gameplay remains familiar  You control a character on this occasion a youth named CJ who sets out on a series of self contained missions within a massive  environment  CJ can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push bike to a city bus to a plane  All come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family  To make things worse he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town and blackmailed by crooked cops played by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn  The setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional US state of San Andreas comprising three major cities  Los Santos which is a thinly disguised Los Angeles San Fierro aka San Francisco and Las Venturas a carbon copy of Las Vegas  San Andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing     Its ability to capture the ambience of the real world versions of these cities is something to behold assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since Vice City  The streets and vast swathes of countryside are by turns gloriously menacing grungy and preppy  Flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail the games overall look particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets is stupendous  The outstanding bread and butter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on  Cars handle more convincingly than ever a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds and theres more traffic to navigate than before  Park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway and within seconds there will be a huge pile up  Pedestrians are also out in force and are a loquacious bunch  CJ can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad  They will pass comments on his appearance and credibility aspects that the player now has control over  Clothes tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool  The character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym  He will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up but will swell up as a result of over eating  And at last this is a GTA hero who can swim     At a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young San Andreas violence or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence are sure to inflame the pro censorship brigade  Developers Rockstar have not shied away from brutality and in some respects ramp it up from past outings     When hijacking a car for example CJ will gratuitously shove the drivers head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle  Indeed the tone is darker than the jokey Vice City  The grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy  setting of the last game  This title incidentally is set in  but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists  The wit is still present just more restrained than in previous outings  A further reason for this is that the incredible range of in vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options where GTA games trademark humour is anchored  The quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off the chart  The games rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed  It is a testament to San Andreas magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws but plus points are so numerous that the niggles dont detract  The on screen map for instance is needlessly fiddly an unwelcome change from past editions  There is also a very jarring slowdown at action packed moments  And the game suffers from the age old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission  But the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive  You simply will not be bothered by these minor failings  San Andreas is among the few unmissable games of

When invention turns to innovation    It is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past     When history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor they were defining technologies which ultimately changed peoples lives substantially  But says Nick Donofrio senior vice president of technology and manufacturing at IBM it was not  the thing  itself that actually improved peoples lives  It was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it  The car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs whilst having mobility and access   When we talk about innovation and creating real value in the  Century we have to think more like this but faster  Mr Donofrio told the BBC News website after giving the Royal Academy of Engineering  Hinton Lecture   The invention discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had   The equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered but by themselves they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did   These are not altogether new ideas and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years  But what it means for technology companies is that a new idea method or device will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them     We are in a different phase now when it comes to technology argues Mr Donofrio Industry Weeks  Technology Leader of the Year  The hype and over promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work make sense make a difference and life gets better as a result      In the dotcom era there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes   Somebody had a new thing that would awe you  You werent quite sure that it did anything you werent quite sure if you needed it you werent quite sure if it had value for it but it was cool   But change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives he says will come about slowly subtlety and in ways that will no longer be  in your face   It will creep in pervasively  Nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways through new superconducting materials to coatings power and memory storage   I am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment in an incredible network infrastructure  says Mr Donofrio  Pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules and where jewellery clothes and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires screens and keyboards  The net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there like air   People will not have to do anything to stay connected  People will know their lives are just better  says Mr Donofrio   Trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know   Natural interfaces will develop devices will shape your persona and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances     Ultimately there will be says Mr Donofrio no value in being  computer illiterate   To some it sounds like a technological world gone mad  To Mr Donofrio it is a vision innovation that will happen  Behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and  deep computing  says Mr Donofrio  Deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data and integral to this concept is supercomputing  It has value according to IBM because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions like how to refine millions of net search results finding cures for diseases or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates     But pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts commands and requirements of a diverse world  As computing and technologies become part of the environment part of furniture walls and clothing physical space becomes a more important consideration     This is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience   I am confident that the SET  science engineering and technology  industry is going to be short on skills  he says   If I am right about what innovation is you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative   Women tend to have those traits a lot better than men   Eventually women could win out in both life and physical sciences he says  In the UK a DTI funded resource centre for women has set a target to have   representation on SET industry boards  IBM according to Mr Donofrio has     Our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career   The whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to Mr Donofrio   We believe in the whole issue of global diversity  he says   Our customers are diverse our clients are diverse  They expect us to look like them   As more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them

Text messages aid disaster recovery    Text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Asia     The messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation  Now some are studying how the technology behind SMS could be better used during an emergency  Sanjaya Senanayake works for Sri Lankan television  The blogging world though might know him better by his online name Morquendi  He was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the Sri Lankan coast  Cell phone signals were weak  Land lines were unreliable  So Mr Senanayake started sending out text messages  The messages were not just the latest news they were also an on the ground assessment of  who needs what and where   Blogging friends in India took Mr Senanayakes text messages and posted them on a weblog called Dogs without Borders  Thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent     And thats when Mr Senanayake started to wonder if SMS might be put to more practical use   SMS networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call  he says      In every rural community theres at least one person who has access to a mobile phone or has a mobile phone and can receive messages   Half a world away in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago Taran Rampersad read Morquendis messages  Mr Rampersad who used to work in the military knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster  He wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help  Mr Rampersad said   Imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets and had a central place to send a text message to that effect   He can message the server so the server can send out an e mail message and human or machine moderators can e mail aid agencies and get it out in the field   He added   Or send it at the same time to other people who are using SMS in the region and they might have an excess of it and be able to shift supplies to the right places      Mr Rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since Hurricane Ivan ravaged the Caribbean and the southern United States last September  Last week he sent out e mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for Asia     In only  hours he found Dan Lane a text message guru living in Britain  The pair along with a group of dedicated techies are creating what they call the Alert Retrieval Cache  The idea is to use open source software   software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint   and a far flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help   This is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people  says Paul Saffo a director at the California based Institute for the Future   You may be halfway around the world from someone but in cyberspace youre just one click or one e mail away  he said  Thats put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because theyre not right on top of the tragedy   It is still very early days for the project though  In an e mail Dan Lane calls it  an early proof of concept   Right now the Alert Retrieval Cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web page or distribute it to an e mail list  In the near future the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages  But theres still another challenge  You have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use   Its amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to and say look this is what were trying to do and everything like that  says Mr Rampersad   So the big problem right now is the same problem were trying to solve   human communication   He is optimistic however  He thinks that the Alert Retrieval Cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments too will sit up and take notice  And he stands by his motto courtesy of Michelangelo  criticise by creating     Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World a BBC World Service and WGBH Boston co production

Putting a face to Big Brother    Literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi tech gadgets     Imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour and perhaps even alert you to new e mails  Basic versions of these so called avatars already exist  Together with speech and voice recognition systems they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future  Some of these ideas have been showcased at the Londons Science Museum as part of its Future Face exhibition     One such avatar is Jeremiah  It is a virtual man which you can download for free and install in your computer     His creator Richard Bowden lecturer at the Centre for Vision Speech and Signal Processing at the University of Surrey refers to Jeremiah as  him  rather than it   Jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity  He is very childlike he likes visual stimulus  he told the BBC News website   When he sees children running and laughing and waving at him he smiles at them  If you ignore him he gets angry  If you leave he gets sad  And you can also even surprise him   Jeremiah is not actually intelligent  It works on vision reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system  It is not able to talk or to hear you at least not yet  The Surrey team is already working on Jeremiahs next version that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature  Finn the fish   I am interested in the interaction providing the ability of a system to watch whats going on and make decisions based on that  explained Dr Bowden     The research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi tech gadgets     Experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices such as a virtual human could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos   If you get up at three oclock in the morning and you go downstairs there are probably two things you are going to do  either going to the bathroom or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea  said Dr Bowden   Now if the system can watch your behaviour over time it can learn this so it would predict what you are going to do turn on the lights for you or before you even get to the kettle it could have switched it on   You might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left  This might sound like a scary vision of an Orwellian future  But it might all depend on the face that is watching you   When we put the surveillance cameras in our centre a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them  said Dr Bowden   But when Jeremiahs camera went in nobody minded because although its still watching them they could see what it was watching

Football Manager scores big time    For the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of Championship Manager CM  Indeed it seems like there has been a CM game for as many years as there have been PCs     However last year was the final time that developers Sports Interactive SI and publishers Eidos would work together  They decided to go their separate ways and each kept a piece of the franchise  SI kept the games code and database and Eidos retained rights to the CM brand and the look and feel of the game  So at the beginning of this year fans faced a new situation  Eidos announced the next CM game with a new team to develop it from scratch whilst SI developed the existing code further to be released with new publishers Sega under the name Football Manager  So what does this mean Well Football Manager is the spiritual successor to the CM series and it has been released earlier than expected  At this point CM looks like it will ship early next year  But given that Football Manager  is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves how does this new version shape up    A game like FM could blind you with statistics  It has an obscene number of playable leagues an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans  But that does not do justice to the game really  What we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the Earth     You begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from for instance England and Scotland  That will give you a choice not just of the four main Scottish leagues but the English Premiership all the way down to the Conference North and South  Of course you might be looking for European glory or to get hold of Abramovichs millions in which case you can take control at Chelsea or even Barcelona Real Madrid AC Milan     the list goes on a very long way  Once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you  Sometimes it is promotion or a place in Europe sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle  It might even be a case of Champions or else  Obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose so choose wisely  Then it is time to look at your squad work out your tactics seeing how much cash if any you have got to splash having a look at the transfer market sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it  Then bring on the matches which are once more available in the ever improving top down  view  With the exception of the improved user interface on the surface not much else seems to have changed     However there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well   things like the manager mind games which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses  The match engine is also much improved and it is more of a joy than ever to watch  In fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked and it leads to an ever more immersive experience     With a game that is so complex and so open ended there are of course a few glitches but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases  With so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches though there have been improvements in this area  And a sport like football which is so high profile and unpredictable itself can never be modelled quite to everybodys satisfaction  But this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only and do not affect gameplay  And if there are problems further down the line Sports Interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible  In all there are many more tweaks and improvements  If you were a fan of the previous CM games then FM might make you forget there was anything else before it  If you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take Margate into the Premiership Spurs into Europe or even putting Rangers back on the top of the tree FM could be the best purchase you ever made  Just be warned that the family might not see you much at Christmas     Football Manager  out now for the PC and the Mac

Musicians upbeat about the net    Musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music a survey has found     The study by US researchers Pew Internet suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file sharing  While most considered file sharing as illegal many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders   Even successful artists dont think the lawsuits will benefit musicians  said report author Mary Madden     For part of the study Pew Internet conducted an online survey of  musicians songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between March and April      They ranged from full time successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music   We looked at more of the independent musicians rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry  Ms Madden told the BBC News website   We always hear the views of successful artists like the Britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented   The survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood  Almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration with nine out of  going online to promote advertise and post their music on the web  More than   offered free samples online while two thirds sold their music via the net  Independent musicians in particular saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly   Musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically  said Ms Madden   They are using the internet to gain inspiration sell it online tracking royalties learning about copyright      Perhaps surprisingly opinions about online file sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry     Through the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music  But the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the US  It found that most artists saw file sharing as both good and bad though most agreed that it should be illegal   Free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing  said one musician quoted by the report   Its hard to keep making records if they dont pay for themselves through sales   However   said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters  Many suggested that rather than fighting file sharing the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it   Both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy  said Ms Madden

Freeze on anti spam campaign    A campaign by Lycos Europe to target spam related websites appears to have been put on hold     Earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites  But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words  Stay tuned   No one at Lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti spam campaign     Lycos Europes  Make love not spam  campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes  People were encouraged to download the screensaver which when their PC was idle would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages  Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at   capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites  But the plan has proved controversial     Monitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline     The downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack  In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them  Laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences  Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold  The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page with the words  Stay tuned   The numerical internet address of the site has also changed  This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site  The campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web  Many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism   Attacking a spammers website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick  said Graham Cluley senior technology consultant for Sophos   Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up

ITunes user sues Apple over iPod    A user of Apples iTunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an iPod to play songs     He says Apple is breaking anti competition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site  Apple which opened its online store in  after launching the iPod in  uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the iPod  Californian Thomas Slattery filed the suit in the US District Court in San Jose and is seeking damages      Apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice  the lawsuit states  The key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like iTunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market according to Ernest Gellhorn an anti trust law professor at George Mason University   As a practical matter the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims  Prof Gellhorn said  Apple has sold more than six million iPods since the gadget was launched and has an   share of the market for portable digital music players market research firm NPD Group has reported     More than  million songs have been sold by the iTunes music store since it was launched   Apple has unlawfully bundled tied and or leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players and vice versa  the lawsuit said  Mr Slattery called himself an iTunes customer who  was also forced to purchase an Apple iPod  if he wanted to take his music with him to listen to  A spokesman for Apple declined to comment  Apples online music store uses a different format for songs than Napster Musicmatch RealPlayer and others  The rivals use the MP format or Microsofts WMA format while Apple uses AAC which it says helps thwart piracy  The WMA format also includes so called Digital Rights Management which is used to block piracy

Blog picked as word of the year    The term  blog  has been chosen as the top word of  by a US dictionary publisher     Merriam Webster said  blog  headed the list of most looked up terms on its site during the last twelve months  During  blogs or web logs have become hugely popular and some have started to influence mainstream media  Other words on the Merriam Webster list were associated with major news events such as the US presidential election or natural disasters that hit the US     Merriam Webster defines a blog as   a Web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections comments and often hyperlinks   Its list of most looked up words is drawn up every year and it discounts terms such as swear words that everyone likes to look up or those that always cause problems such as  affect  and  effect      Merriam Webster said  blog  was the word that people have asked to be defined or explained most often over the last  months  The word will now appear in the  version of Merriam Websters printed dictionary  However the word is already included in some printed versions of the Oxford English Dictionary  A spokesman for the Oxford University Press said that the word was now being put into other dictionaries for children and learners reflecting its mainstream use   I think it was the word of last year rather than this year  he said   Now were getting words that derive from it such as blogosphere and so on  he said   But  he added  its a pretty recent thing and in the way that this happens these days its got established very quickly      Blogs come in many different forms  Many act as news sites for particular groups or subjects some are written from a particular political slant and others are simply lists of interesting sites  Other terms in the top  were related to natural disasters that have struck the US such as  hurricane  or were to do with the US election  Words such as  incumbent   electoral  and  partisan  reflected the scale of interest in the vote  Blogs also proved very useful to both sides in the US election battle because many pundits who maintain their own journals were able to air opinions that would never appear in more mainstream media  Speculation that President Bush was getting help during debates via a listening device was first aired on web logs  Online journals also raised doubts about documents used by US television news organisation CBS in a story about President Bushs war record  The immediacy of many blogs also helped some wield influence over topics that made it in to national press     This is despite the fact that the number of people reading even the most influential blogs is tiny  Statistics by web influence ranking firm HitWise reveal that the most popular political blog racks up only    of all net visits per day  One of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online  According to blog analysis firm Technorati the number of blogs in existence the blogosphere has doubled every five and a half months for the last  months  Technorati now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded   million  Some speculate that less than a quarter of this number are regularly maintained  According to US research firm Pew Internet   American Life a blog is created every   seconds  Another trend this year has been the increasing numbers of weblogs that detail the daily lives of many ordinary workers in jobs that few people know much about  In many repressive regimes and developing nations blogs have been embraced by millions of people keen to give their plight a voice

DS aims to touch gamers    The mobile gaming industry is set to explode in  with a number of high profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback  Market leader Nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played     The first striking thing about the DS is how retro it looks  Far from looking like a mould breaking handheld it looks more like Nintendo dug out a mould from a  handheld prototype  The lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree  Both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive  Nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen     The Japanese gaming giant hopes the DS will maintain the firms pre eminence in an increasingly competitive mobile gaming market     Nintendo first launched its GameBoy console in  and has dominated the market ever since  But its lead can no longer be taken for granted  Sony will enter the market later this year with its PlayStation Portable while start up companies Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac are also offering hybrid devices   We believe the DS will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill  said David Yarnton Nintendo Europes general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld  With its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the GameBoy Advance the DS certainly has a number of unique selling points  It went on sale in the US in mid November priced   and Nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures  Japan and Europe will have to wait until the first quarter of  to get the device  With more than two million pre orders for the device in Japan Nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot  But will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed The game ships with a demo of Metroid Hunters   a  action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machines wireless capabilities  It certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people     The game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim  The top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top down map and the ability to switch weapons  It is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating  Super Mario  DS is a faithful re creation of the Nintendo  classic with a host of new mini games and new levels  The game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine  One thing is for certain  Hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices Ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers  If they manage to create titles which use the Nintendo DSs key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up  The fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks

No half measures with Half Life     Could Half Life  possibly live up to the hype After almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays its safe to say that this is the most highly anticipated computer game of all time     Fortunately it doesnt merely live up to its promise but exceeds it  No one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long  The impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped  All the money   or indeed time   is on the screen  The player sees things through the eyes of Gordon Freeman the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original  Half Life  Having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster infested research facility hes back in another foreboding troublespot   the enigmatic City   It has the look of a beautiful Eastern European city but as soon as your train pulls in to the station its clear that all is not well here  Sinister police patrol the unkempt streets and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer  A casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be     You are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task  It is not immediately explained what your objectives are nor precisely why everything is so ravaged  Finding out step by step is all part of the experience although you never fully get to understand what it was all about  That does not really matter  HL does not waste energy blinding you with plot  Underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective and immerses the player in the most vivid convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen  There are no cut scenes to interrupt the flow  Exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you     Whereas the highly impressive Doom III felt like a top notch theme park thrill ride wandering through Half Lifes world truly does feel like being part of a movie     Considering its sophistication the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications  But if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your PCs components this is it  On our test machine   an Alienware system with an Athlon   processor and ATIs Radeon X video card   everything ran at full quality without trouble and the visual experience was simply jaw dropping  It is not simply that the surfaces textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them  The haunting grim landscapes become strangely beautiful  Luckily you get time to pause mid task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings  So impressive are the physics that youll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move  There are puzzles to be solved along the way pitched at about the right difficulty but most progress is achieved by force  Freeman is quickly reunited with the original games famous crowbar and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow     Virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with and in realistic fashion  You will be wowed by the attention to detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls chase a pigeon out of your way or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed  At times Half Life  feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to and in a curious way its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome  Running around on foot is great enough but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun  Human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones  The stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles  In gameplay terms HL somehow gets almost everything perfect  And without resorting to the zombies leaping out of shadows approach of Doom III its all incredibly unsettling  The vacant environment is distinctly eerie and at one point I even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside     The game does have a couple of problems  Firstly the carefully scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people     A lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue which makes for exciting moments but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once youve completed it  If you like things open ended and free ranging Far Cry will be a lot more pleasing  But the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run  Installing it proved a life draining siege that would test a saints patience  Developer Valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy  The box does warn you of this anti piracy measure but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded  The time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed the temperamental Valve servers and the time of day but it can take hours  It would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances   but luckily Half Life  is up to the challenge  It is surely the best thing in its genre and possibly many will feel of any genre  The bar has been raised and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future     Half Life  is out now for the PC

Games win for Blu ray DVD format    The next generation DVD format Blu ray is winning more supporters than its rival according to its backers     Blu ray backed by  firms including Sony is competing against Toshiba and NEC backed HD DVD to be the format of choice for future films and games  The Blu Ray Association said on Thursday that games giants Electronic Arts and Vivendi would both support its DVD format  The next generation of DVDs will hold high definition video and sound  This offers incredible  like quality of pictures which major Hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year  In a separate press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Toshiba announced that DVD players for its technology would be on the market by the end of       As we move from standard definition video images to high definition images we have a much greater need for storage  Richard Doherty from Panasonics Hollywood Laboratories one of the pioneers of Blu ray told the BBC news website   So by utilising blue laser based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as todays DVD   A Blu ray disc will be able to store  of high quality data while Toshibas HD DVD will hold   Mr Doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high definition needs including the ability to record onto the DVDs and smaller discs to fit into camcorders  Both Toshiba and Blu ray are hopeful that the emerging DVD format war akin to the Betamax and VHS fight in the  can be resolved over the next year when next generation DVD players start to come out  When players do come out they will be able to play standard DVDs too which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current DVDs     But the support from Vivendi and Electronics Arts is a big boost to Blu ray in the battle for supremacy     Gaming is a   billion industry worldwide so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made   The technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical disc technologies  said Michael Heilmann chief technology officer for Vivendi Universal   Blu ray offers the capacity performance and high speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming   EA a leading games developer and publisher added that the delivery of high definition games of the future was vital and Blu ray had the capacity functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning  Sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of PlayStations  Mr Doherty said gamers were  ravenous  for high quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles   Gamers especially those working on PCs are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures deeper levels for delivering higher resolution playback      He added   The focus for games moving forward on increased immersion      Gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated  models and textures and increasing the resolution increasing the frame rate   all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience   Fitting these models on current DVD technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost  As games move to more photo real capability the current technology is limiting   They are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments  said Mr Doherty  Currently graphics intensive PC games also require multiple discs for installation  High definition DVDs will cut down on that need  Likewise consoles rely on single discs so DVDs that can hold six times more data mean much better high resolution games  Blu ray has already won backing from major Hollywood studios such as MGM Studios Disney and Buena Vista as well as top technology firms like Dell LG Samsung and Phillips amongst others  While Toshibas HD DVD technology has won backing from Paramount Universal and Warner Bros   The real world benefits of HD DVD are apparent and obvious  said Jim Cardwell president of Warner Home Video  Mr Cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with HD DVD  Both formats are courting Microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation Xbox but discussions are still on going  Next generation DVDs will also be able to store images and other data  CES is the largest consumer electronics show in the world and runs from  to  January

File swappers ready new network    Legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down     One site behind the success of the BitTorrent file swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program  A test version of the new Exeem program will be released in late January  But doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are  quality copies      In late December movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the BitTorrent network  The legal campaign worked because of the way that BitTorrent is organised  That file sharing system relies on links called  trackers  that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for  Shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the BitTorrent network  One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to     Now the man behind suprnova org who goes by the nickname Sloncek is preparing to release software for a new file swapping network dubbed Exeem  In an interview with Novastream web radio Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file sharing systems  Like BitTorrent Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want  Like Kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone  There will be no centrally maintained list  This said Sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music  The Exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users  An early public version of the software should be available before February  Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software was in development  There were no plans for a Linux or Mac version  He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program  Despite Suprnova administrator Slonceks involvement with Exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called Swarm Systems that is based on Caribbean island Saint Kitts and Nevis     Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files Sloncek told Novastream     Dr Johan Pouwelse a researcher at the Delft University of Technology who studies peer to peer networks said Exeem was the next evolution in file sharing systems  But he said it would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared   Exeem cannot prevent pollution  he said   The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings  he said  Studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine Kazaa by putting in fakes  By contrast moderators on Suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality   The moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one thats full of crap like Kazaa  he said   There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity  he said  Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of file sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading  When big files were being shared moderation systems were key said Mr Pouwelse  He added that the legal attacks on BitTorrent had driven people away from sites such as Suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic   Its hard to compete with free  he said  No one from the Motion Picture Association of America was immediately available for comment on the file sharing development

Online games play with politics    After bubbling under for some time online games broke through onto the political arena in      The US presidential election provided a showcase for many aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads  Experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society  The first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of   the Iowa Game commissioned by the Democrat hopeful Howard Dean  More than  followed suit including Frontrunner eLections President Forever and The Political Machine which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign including having to cope with the media  Others helped raise the stakes during the Bush Kerry contest by highlighting a candidates virtues or his vices     The phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games a handful of multi discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers      When I started researching political games at the university about five years ago I thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen  said Gonzalo Frasca computer games specialist at the Information Technology University of Copenhagen   I must admit that I was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved  added the Uruguayan born researcher who has so far created games for two political campaigns  Many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming com  The aim is to comment on international news events via games     The ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way      Video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation  Mr Frasca told the BBC News website  This was the case with the one he created for a political party in Uruguay Cambiemos an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the countrys problems could be solved by working together   Its up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games   Ultimately Dr Frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes fears and beliefs   Children learn a lot about the world through play  There is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up      But experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns     This is hardly surprising compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web  Only a few years ago most politicians did not have a webpage while now it is almost a must have  Dr Frasca said   Political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games  They represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them    It will not replace other forms of political propaganda but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns

Freeze on anti spam campaign    A campaign by Lycos Europe to target spam related websites appears to have been put on hold     Earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites  But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words  Stay tuned   No one at Lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti spam campaign     Lycos Europes  Make love not spam  campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes  People were encouraged to download the screensaver which when their PC was idle would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages  Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at   capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites  But the plan has proved controversial     Monitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline     The downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack  In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them  Laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences  Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold  The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page with the words  Stay tuned   The numerical internet address of the site has also changed  This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site  The campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web  Many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism   Attacking a spammers website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick  said Graham Cluley senior technology consultant for Sophos   Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up

When technology gets personal    In  whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass     By then phones will be printed directly on to wrists or other parts of the body says Ian Pearson BTs resident futurologist     Its all part of whats known as a  pervasive ambient world  where  chips are everywhere   Mr Pearson does not have a crystal ball  His job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now to guide industries into the future  Inanimate objects will start to interact with us  we will be surrounded   on streets in homes in appliances on our bodies and possibly in our heads   by things that  think   Forget local area networks   these will be body area networks  Ideas about just how smart small or even invisible technology will get are always floating around  Images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology  But now a new vision is surfacing where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality form or aesthetics  Such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed     So MP players   the mass gadget of the moment   will disappear and instead become integrated into ones clothing says Mr Pearson   So the gadgets that fill up your handbag when we integrate those into fabric we can actually get rid of all that stuff  You wont necessarily see the electronics   Wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up while  video tattoos  or intelligent electronic contact lenses might function as TV screens for those on the move  However this future of highly personal devices where technology is worn or even fuses with the body itself raises ethical questions  If technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing jewellery and skin there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans says Baroness Susan Greenfield  At a recent conference for technology engineering academic and fashion industry experts at the Royal Society in London neuroscientist Baroness Greenfield cautioned we  cant just sleepwalk into the future      Yet this technology is already upon us  Researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing  MP jackets based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves have already appeared in shops     These  smart fabrics  have come about through advances in nano  and micro engineering   the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale  At the nanoscale materials can be  tuned  to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster lighter stronger and more efficient devices and systems  The textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways  Many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine defence healthcare sports and communications  Professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin  Nanoscale titanium dioxide TiO coatings give fabrics antibacterial and anti odour properties  These have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or UV light  Such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance to turn airline seats into super stain resistant surfaces and applied to windows so they clean themselves  Dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin  But Baroness Greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being  If our clothing skin and  personal body networks  do the talking and the monitoring everywhere we go we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy  Mr Pearson picks up the theme pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become  cyborgian   His main concern is  privacy    We are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really dont want every passer by to know   So we have to make sure we build security in this  If you are wearing smart make up where electronics are controlling the appearance you dont want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead   As technology infiltrates our biology how will our brains function differently  We cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this  warns Baroness Greenfield  There have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards  This paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers  Clearly the organic carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging  The cyborg   a very familiar part human part inorganic science fiction and academic idea   is on its way

Doors open at biggest gadget fair    Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show CES     The fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year  About  new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds  Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox     The thrust of this years show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store listen to and watch what they want on devices any time anywhere  About  people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than   million square feet  Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging storage technologies thinner flat screen and high definition TVs wireless and portable technologies gaming and broadband technologies  The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel Microsoft and Hewlett Packard among others   The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them  Jeff Joseph from the Consumer Electronics Association CEA told the BBC News website   It is about personalisation   taking your MP player and creating your own playlist taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when   you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters      Consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in  according to figures released by CES organisers the CEA on Tuesday  The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in   Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost   between  and   That trend is predicted to continue according to CEA analysts with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by   again in   The fastest growing technologies in  included blank DVD media Liquid Crystal Display LCD TVs digital video recorders DVRs and portable music players   This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting   so if you have your PVR  personal video recorder  in your living room you can move that content around the house   Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere  said Mr Joseph  He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the  democratisation  of content   devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music video and images  There will also be more focus on the design of technologies following the lead that Apples iPod made with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern     The CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year  Gaming would continue to thrive especially on mobile devices and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women  Games consoles sales have been declining but the launch of next generation consoles such as Microsofts Xbox and PlayStation could buoy up sales  Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote  Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead  With more than   of US homes expected to have home networks the CEA suggested hard drive boxes   or media servers   capable of storing thousands of images video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home will be more commonplace  Portable devices that combine mobile telephony digital music and video players will also be more popular in   Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films TV and audio wherever they are  This means more storage technologies will be in demand such as external hard drives and flash memory like SD cards  CES runs officially from  to  January

Who do you think you are    The real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net argues analyst Bill Thompson  It is what happens when it arrives at the other end     The Financial Services Authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data  The fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society   our identities  Armed with the personal details that a bank holds plus a fake letter or two it is apparently easy to get a loan open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone elses name  And it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving  Identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish     But however careful you may be if the organisations you trust with your personal data bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble  It is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system  In fact I suspect that the FSA is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time  Has anyone checked Bob Cratchits family links to the criminal underworld I wonder And it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted  Health authorities government agencies and of course the big e commerce sites like Amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters  The good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to  And as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details  Fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office plugging it into a USB slot and sucking down customer files     Companies like SecureWave for example can restrict the use of USB ports just to authorised devices or even to an individuals personal memory card  These solutions are not perfect but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system  However the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e commerce and online trading   the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the back office  It has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked     In fact I do not know of a single case where an e mail containing payment details has led to card fraud     There are simply too many e mails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud  CD Universe Powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences  And just last week the online bank Cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name  Whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job the issue is the same  how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused Any organisation that processes personal data is of course bound by the Data Protection Act and must take proper care of it  Unauthorised disclosure is not allowed but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the Act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice  This is not something we can just leave it to the market  The consequences of having ones identity stolen are too serious and markets respond too slowly  After all I bank with Cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that I did not even consider it when I heard about their security problems  I doubt many others have closed their accounts especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future  The two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft  I have never felt comfortable with the US practice of suing everything that moves partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients so I know which Id prefer     Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital

Europe backs digital TV lifestyle    How people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change following the launch of an ambitious European project     In Nice last week the European Commission announced its Networked   Electronic Media NEM initiative  Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created through each of the stages of its distribution to its playback  The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly when on the move at home or at work no matter who supplies the devices network content or content protection scheme  More than  experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia Intel Philips Alcatel France Telecom Thomson and Telefonica  It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together  But again and again speakers stated they could not see incompatible stand alone solutions working  A long term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required     The European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach  They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses  The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline pick out the best bring them together and identify where the gaps are  Where it finds holes it will develop standards to fill them  What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget  This is bound to please if not surprise many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer  Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management DRM schemes  Currently DRM solutions are incompatible locking certain types of purchased content making them unplayable on all platforms  With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally the prize for being the supplier of the worlds dominant DRM scheme is huge  Although entertainment is an obvious first step it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare energy efficiency and control of the smart home  The  year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the EC has been funding for a number of years     Simon Perry is the editor of the Digital Lifestyles website which covers the impact of technology on media

A decade of good website design    The web looks very different today than it did  years ago     Back in  Yahoo had only just launched most websites were text based and Amazon Google and eBay had yet to appear  But says usability guru Dr Jakob Nielsen some things have stayed constant in that decade namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use  Dr Nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the  core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today   Roughly   of the things we found  years ago are still an issue today  he said   Some have gone away because users have changed and   have changed because technology has changed      Some design crimes such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared said Dr Nielsen      But theres great stability on usability concerns  he told the BBC News website  Dr Nielsen said the basic principles of usability centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a sites total design were as important as ever   Its necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such  he said  They are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would   A lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off  he said   But there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband      Dr Nielsen said the success of sites such as Google Amazon eBay and Yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important   Those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful  said Dr Nielsen adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net      All are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet  he said   They are making simple but powerful tools available to the user   None of them have a fancy or glamorous look  he added declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied  In the future Dr Nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online   They are becoming like the operating system to the internet  he said  But he said the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better  Currently he said search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries  Often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not  Tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results  Research by Dr Nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines  The latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that on average they use   terms  In  only   words were used   I think its amazing that we have seen a doubling in a  year period of those search terms  said Dr Nielsen     You can hear more from Jakob Nielsen and web design on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital

 Metal Slug offers retro fun    Like some drill sergeant from the past Metal Slug  is a wake up call to todays gamers molly coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings     With its hand animated sprites and  side scrolling this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago  But a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year  And yes that includes Halo   Simply choose your grunt and wade through five  side scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter  It is also the toughest game you are likely to play as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on     Players must battle soldiers snowmen zombies giant crabs and aliens not to mention the huge screen filling bosses that guard each of the five levels     The shoot anything that moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old school genius  Fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers instead to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware  Tanks jets and submarines can be commandeered as well as cannon toting camels elephants and ostriches   more weaponry on offer than in an acre of Iraq  Doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls and while this is a tough nut to crack it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go  And at a mere    Metal Slug  is as cheap as sliced fried spuds as the man says  Of course most of you will ignore this lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters  But at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation Metal Slug  is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the Xbox was not even a twinkle in Bill Gates eye

Supercomputer breaks speed record    The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBMs prototype Blue Gene L machine     It is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory a US Department of Energy DOE lab  DOE test results show that Blue Gene L has managed speeds of   teraflops  The current top machine Japans NEC Earth Simulator clocks up    Due next week the Top  list officially charts the fastest computers in the world  It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second  The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles     The US Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed according to the Linpack benchmark  Until the official list is published however Blue Gene Ls position will not be confirmed and there are expected to be some other new entries  But the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement  Surpassing the  trillion calculations per second teraflop mark has been considered a landmark for some time     The IBM Blue Gene L is only a prototype and is one  the speed of the full version due to be completed for the Livermore labs in   Its peak theoretical performance is expected to be  teraflops and will fit into  full racks  It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power a big problem for supercomputers  The final machine will help scientists work out the safety security and reliability requirements for the USs nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for underground nuclear testing  The Earth Simulator has held on to the top spot since June   It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity  But in September IBM said that another Blue Gene L machine clocked up   teraflops marginally surpassing the Earth Simulators performance  This was achieved during internal testing at IBMs production facility in Rochester Minnesota though so was not an official record  Another giant to enter the fray is Silicon Graphics Columbia supercomputer based at Nasas Ames Research Center in California  It would be used to model flight missions climate research and aerospace engineering  The Linux based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of   teraflops in October     Supercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society  Their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts help design better cars and improve disease diagnosis  IBMs senior vice president of technology and manufacturing Nick Donofrio believes that by  Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing  This means it would be capable of doing  trillion operations a second   When you get a computer as large as a petaflop you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world  Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website      You can start to be more proactive more interactive and more innovative   One area where Mr Donofrio sees supercomputing   and Blue Gene machines in particular   as crucial is health  He believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the  Century  protein folding   Health is one of the most important problems not just mapping the human genome but also protein structures   We are a great believer in simulation  It gives you another tool  he said  Once the structures of proteins are understood fully then drugs can be tailor made to fight diseases more effectively  Compared with the current fastest supercomputers Blue Gene is designed to consume one  the power and be  times more compact  Since the first supercomputer the Cray  was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in  computational speed has leaped  times  The Cray  was capable of  megaflops  million operations a second  The Blue Gene L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster  Started in  the Top  list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world  It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh

Gadgets galore on show at fair    The  Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geeks paradise with more than  new gadgets and technologies launched during the four day event     Top gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics  The BBC News website took an early pre show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in            One of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images audio and video files  The   and  circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help  The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket   It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool  said Seagate   It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality    It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy  it said  In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures           Universal Electronics NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content such as photos no matter where it is in their house  It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems  Working with home broadband networks and PCs the gadget has built in wireless and a colourful simple interface  Paul Arling UEI chief said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices  He said the Nevo gave people a simple single way to regain some control over digital media in the home  The Nevo won two awards at CES one as a Girls Best Friend award and another for innovation design and engineering  The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about                Hotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair  The specially designed chair lets gamers play in surround sound while stretching out in their own  space   It is compatible with all the major games consoles DVD players and PCs   We found that kids love playing in surround sound  said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat   We are looking at offering different types of seats depending on the market success of this one   The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos with wireless control for six surround sound speakers  And a drinks holder  The chair which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame should go on sale in April and is expected to cost                Satellite radio is big business in the US  In the UK the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology  Eton Corporations Porsche designed P digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US  DAB sets have been slow to take off in the UK but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology   It is for the risqu    consumer  said an Eton spokesperson   We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design conscious consumer   The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of  in the UK  In the US is it expected to cost                The average person has a library of  digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association the organisation behind CES  This is expected to grow to a massive  images   or     in five years time  One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyos tiny handheld VPC C camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner  It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device  It takes MPEG video quality at  frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera  Images and video are stored on SD cards which have come down in price in recent months  A  card will store about  minutes of video and  stills  The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb  Because images and video are stored on SD memory it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too           Wearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design  MPIOs tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good  Slung on a cord the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck  Although the pendant design was launched three months ago the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion conscious gadget fiends  An even dinkier model the FY comes out in May and will store about  of music  The range of players recently won an International Forum design award

Learning to love broadband    We are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life at least for some argues technology analyst Bill Thompson     One of the nice things about being a writer is that I rarely have to go to an office to work  I can sit in a caf    or a library with or without a wi fi connection and research and write articles  If I am passing through Kings Cross station on my way to a meeting then I can log on from the platform  And I can spend the day working with my girlfriend Anne a childrens writer at her house in Cambridge sharing her wireless network  But just over a week ago I arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection     We checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again  She called her service provider and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem  This did not seem too bad but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on Wednesday  With no modem installed in her computer she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial up connection on her daughters laptop so she had to choose between copying her files onto her USB memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection  As a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial up     She could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively  But the impact spread into her personal life too  She did not take her children to the cinema during half term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas  She planned a trip to Norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the BBC website  And she did not know where to go fossil hunting on the trip because she could not type  fossils Norfolk  into Google  Of course she readily admits she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper listened to the radio or found a book on fossils  But she did not because having fast always on and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things  She may be unusual but I do not think Anne is alone     According to Ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the UK in April  and numbers are climbing fast  There will certainly be five million by the end of the year  Dial up users are switching to broadband  My dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start  More and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason     It is part of the process of adaptation and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the UK and elsewhere  People who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it and show off the cool stuff they can do  They encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity  Of course broadband in the UK is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world  In South Korea Japan and Hong Kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits or millions of bits a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with  But speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband and when it comes to checking websites for film times looking at weather forecasts or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives even UK speeds are sufficient  It may not be the brave new world of streaming full screen video and superfast file downloads but it will do for now  And it is certainly better than slow access or no access  Just ask Anne     Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital

Nintendo DS aims to touch gamers    The mobile gaming industry is set to explode in  with a number of high profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback  Market leader Nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played     The first striking thing about the DS is how retro it looks  Far from looking like a mould breaking handheld it looks more like Nintendo dug out a mould from a  handheld prototype  The lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree  Both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive  Nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen     The Japanese gaming giant hopes the DS will maintain the firms pre eminence in an increasingly competitive mobile gaming market     Nintendo first launched its GameBoy console in  and has dominated the market ever since  But its lead can no longer be taken for granted  Sony will enter the market later this year with its PlayStation Portable while start up companies Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac are also offering hybrid devices   We believe the DS will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill  said David Yarnton Nintendo Europes general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld  With its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the GameBoy Advance the DS certainly has a number of unique selling points  It went on sale in the US in mid November priced   and Nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures  Japan and Europe will have to wait until the first quarter of  to get the device  With more than two million pre orders for the device in Japan Nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot  But will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed The game ships with a demo of Metroid Hunters   a  action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machines wireless capabilities  It certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people     The game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim  The top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top down map and the ability to switch weapons  It is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating  Super Mario  DS is a faithful re creation of the Nintendo  classic with a host of new mini games and new levels  The game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine  One thing is for certain  Hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices Ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers  If they manage to create titles which use the Nintendo DSs key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up  The fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks

China blocks Google news site    China has been accused of blocking access to Google News by the media watchdog Reporters Without Borders     The Paris based pressure group said the English language news site had been unavailable for the past  days  It said the aim was to force people to use a Chinese edition of the site which according to the watchdog does not include critical reports  Google told the BBC News website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes     China is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world     A net police force monitors websites and e mails and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information  Popular Chinese portals such as Sina com and Sohu com maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments  And all  net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive      China is censoring Google News to force internet users to use the Chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports  said the group in a statement   By agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government Google has let itself be used by Beijing  it said  For its part the search giant said it was looking into the issue   It appears that many users in China are having difficulty accessing Google News sites in China and we are working to understand and resolve the issue  said a Google spokesperson  Google News gathers information from some  news sources  Headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm with no human editorial intervention  It offers  editions of the service including one tailored for China and one for Hong Kong  Google launched a version in simplified Chinese in September  The site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information  But Google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within China as this would result in broken links

A question of trust and technology    A major government department is without e mail for a week and technology analyst Bill Thompson wants to know what happened     A couple of weeks ago I wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days  It seems that thousands of civil servants at the UKs Department of Work and Pensions went through the same thing last week  It has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way depriving staff of e mail and access to the application software they use to calculate peoples benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances  Senior consultants from EDS the computer firm which manage the system and Microsoft which supplied the software were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all while staff resorted to phone fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done  Fortunately the back office systems which actually pay people their money were still working so only new claims and updates were affected done properly  This is bad enough for those affected but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners  I am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans     Although the full story has not yet been told it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from Windows  to Windows XP went wrong and XP code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network     This is certainly unfortunate but I have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved  Todays computer networks are large complex and occasionally fragile  The interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems  It is the network equivalent of Godels Theorem   any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically  So I will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck  What is really disturbing and cannot be excused is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press     It is without a doubt a major story and was the second or third lead item on BBC Radio  Today programme throughout Friday morning     So why did not the prime ministers official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before Friday Why was not the pensions minister in Parliament to make an emergency statement on Tuesday when it was clear that there was a serious problem If there had been an outbreak of Legionnaires disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment  While EDS and Microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lessons to learn from their week of pain we can learn some political lessons too  And the most important is that in this digital world technology failures are matters of public interest not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice care or understand  That means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it  It would be unacceptable for any of the parties involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege  A major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently  Anything less is a betrayal of public trust     Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital

Call for action on internet scam    Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet  rogue dialling  scams according to premium phone line regulator Icstis     It has received  complaints in recent months about dial up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users knowledge  Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for  They must warn people earlier about possible fraud Icstis said     People who use dial up connections can be affected by the scams  Without realising a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line  Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill  Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said   Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner   If my bill goes over the usual    a month I want to know about it straight away   I dont want to be told when its hit         Phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially inflated traffic he said   We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers  he added     Telecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said   Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary   So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach   The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling  Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because under the current system once the call has been made theres little that can be done     Gavin Patterson group managing director for BT Consumer said  We do look at customers calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary   Were looking at the moment at whether we can improve this   But as BT handled  million calls a day monitoring was  quite a task in itself  he added  The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future  At the moment it cannot demand pay outs on the behalf of customer   it can only close illegal services down     I use free anti virus software AVG and free firewall protection ZoneAlarm  Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughters love of music sites  How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues     Ignorance is and always has been an expensive business     Does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently so are these people followed up and prosecuted     These diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP porn and pirated software  If people didnt visit such sites theyd be considerably less at risk  Whatever happened to personal responsibility It seems everyone has to be a victim these days!    Part of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems  A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the users knowledge     These scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them  They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators  Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going    Why dont BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customers request To anyone who falls foul of this scam   refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls  After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions they cannot insist on you paying the bill  To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud  No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills     Disable or remove your modem and use broadband instead   then you have nothing to worry about  Or buy some decent firewall software and anti virus  You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat   you would not drive your car without any insurance   so why not protect your PC Stop blaming the phone companies   its not their fault!    I was very impressed with our phone company recently  I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were  odd calls to the same number  Great service  And I got the tickets as well!    I have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam  He informed the phone company about it they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers  Three months later another huge bill of over    came in   the block apparently didnt work and he still has to pay for it even though a block was in place  Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill otherwise theyd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem     I have been scammed of     The operator will do nothing about this and to add insult to injury I was charged VAT by the government     Premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented  One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid  The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly     I know people who have run up large bills despite being IT literate  From talking to BT in Belfast I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing  Its not the fault of phone companies and at last they are doing something about it     Its about time that the profiteering by the legitimate phone companies came to an end mainly by doing away with dial up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly     I havent  fallen victim to a rogue dialling scam  but I think youre seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography  In most cases the user is entirely at fault which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them     My telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal    to    to     This was because of the scam  They simply billed me  What particularly galls me over and above having over    stolen is that the supplier and the government through VAT are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses     How about an automatic monthly cap of say    on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage  At least any disputed amount would be limited far easier for a telecoms operator to write off    than it is        A few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection     How about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti virus and firewall software is up to date That should prevent the vast majority of these scams

Screensaver tackles spam websites    Net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites    Internet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e mail  Lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out  The net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data      Weve never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do  said Malte Pollmann spokesman for Lycos Europe   In the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users  he said  but now we are going to go one step further       Weve found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers   By getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver Lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity  Mr Pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with  He said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web   Every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day  he said  about one MP file   But he said if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day  Lycos did not want to use e mail to fight back said Mr Pollmann   That would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing  he said     The sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer     Typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day  The list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real time blacklists generated by organisations such as Spamcop  To limit the chance of mistakes being made Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods  As these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs the burden of high bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive said Mr Pollmann  Sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests  Early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to    Users do not have to be registered users of Lycos to download and use the screensaver  While working the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data  The screensaver is due to be launched across Europe on  December and before now has only been trialled in Sweden  Despite the soft launch Mr Pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than  times in the last four days   Theres a huge user demand to not only filter spam day by day but to do something more  he said  Before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive

First look at PlayStation  chip    Some details of the chip inside Sonys PlayStation  have been revealed     Sony IBM and Toshiba have released limited data about the so called Cell chip that will be able to carry out trillions of calculations per second  The chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together  The PlayStation  is expected in  but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch     The three firms have been working on the chip since  but before now few details have been released about how it might function  In a joint statement the three firms gave hints about how the chip will work but fuller details will be released in February next year at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco     The three firms claim that the Cell chip will be up to  times more powerful than existing processors  When put inside powerful computer servers the Cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling  trillion floating point operations or calculations every second  The chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media  IBM said it would start producing the chip in early  at manufacturing plants in the US  The first machines off the line using the Cell processor will be computer workstations and servers  A working version of the PS is due to be shown off in May  but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until   As well as being inside the PlayStation  the chip will also be used inside high definition TVs and powerful computers   In the future all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network  said Ken Kutaragi Chief Operating Officer of Sony   Current PC architecture is nearing its limits

Online commons to spark debate    Online communities set up by the UK government could encourage public debate and build trust says the Institute of Public Policy Research IPPR     Existing services such as eBay could provide a good blueprint for such services says the think tank  Although the net is becoming part of local and central government its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online  commons  for public debate  In its report Is Online Community A Policy Tool the IPPR also asks if ID cards could help create safer online communities  Adopting an eBay type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection   What we are proposing is a civic commons  Will Davies senior research fellow at the IPPR told the BBC News website   A single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication   like a pre legislation discussion      The idea of a  civic commons  was originally proposed by Stephen Coleman professor of e democracy at the Oxford Internet Institute  The IPPR report points to informal small scale examples of such commons that already exist  It mentions good practice public initiatives like the BBCs iCan project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues     But he adds government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too  Proposals for ID cards for instance could also be widened to see if they could be used online  They could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer to peer interaction online   At the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services  said Mr Davies   But what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities   The key idea to take from systems such as eBay and other online communities is letting members rate each others reputation by how they treat other members  Using a similar mechanism trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built  This could mean a civic commons would work within a non market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly recognised rules     E government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web  Many online communities such as chatrooms mailing lists community portals message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues     With   of UK households now with access to the net the government suggests Mr Davies could act as an intermediary or  middleman  to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more  cosmopolitan politics  and public trust in policy   Government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online   But it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic non market interactions  said Mr Davies  There is a role for public bodies like the BBC libraries and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of  cliques  talking to each other he added  The paper is part of the IPPRs Digital Society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of A Manifesto For A Digital Britain

Gadget market to grow in     The explosion in consumer technology is to continue into  delegates at the worlds largest gadget show in Las Vegas have been told     The number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by   while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important   Everything is going digital  Kirsten Pfeifer from the Consumer Electronics Association told the BBC News website  The Consumer Electronics Show CES featured the pick of  products   Consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like HDTVs  high definition TVs  digital radio and digital cameras will remain strong in    All the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry   Despite showing diversity some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much  wow factor  as in previous years     The portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of CES which was the  time and place shifting  of multimedia content   being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere at any time  At the start of last years CES the CEA predicted there would be an average growth of   in   That figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players personal video recorders and digital cameras  It was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed  Part of this has been the rise in spending power of the  generation X ers  who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them  More than   of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers according to CEA research  Hybrid devices which combine a number of multimedia functions were also in evidence on the show floor   A lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it  said Stephen Baker a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm NPD Group   Some of these functions cost next to nothing to add      As well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable MP players to giant high definition TVs several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders such as Microsoft chief Bill Gates  Despite several embarrassing technical glitches during Mr Gates pre show speech he announced several new partnerships   mainly for the US market  He unveiled new ways of letting people take TV shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices  He disappointed some however by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the Xbox games console  Another disappointment was the lack of exposure Sonys new portable games device the PSP had at the show  Sony said the much anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in March for the US and Europe  It went on sale in Japan before Christmas  There were only two PSPs embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details  A Sony representative told the BBC News website this was because Sony did not consider it to be part of their  consumer technology  offering     Elsewhere at the show there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens including Samsungs  inch   metre plasma   the largest in the world  Industry experts were also excited about high definition technologies coming to the fore in  with new formats for DVDs coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional DVDs  With so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage like Seagates  pocket sized external hard drive which won an innovation for engineering and design prize  More than  trade professionals attended CES in Las Vegas which officially ran from  to  January

Swap offer for pirated Windows XP    Computer giant Microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones     The first time initiative is restricted to the UK and to users with pre installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November  Until December Microsoft said software can be sent to it for analysis if there are doubts about its legitimacy  The company aims to detect illegal traders and turn users of fake versions of Windows into legitimate ones     The Windows XP Counterfeit Project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free subject to certain conditions until the end of the year  It is the first time Microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world the company told the BBC News website  In June the software giant said that the major security update to Windows XP Service Pack  would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system  The upgrade closed security loopholes in XP and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code     The US company invited anyone who had suspicions about their version of Windows XP to submit it for testing as soon as possible  The procedure consists of a series of computer checks collating documents and filling out a witness statement   This is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of Windows XP software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders  said Alex Hilton licence compliance manager at Microsoft  The scheme has also been welcomed by the technology and commerce industry   It is important that users ensure that they are legally licensed to avoid the risks of purchasing and using counterfeit products  said David Frost director general of the British Chambers of Commerce  The plan would enable Microsoft to gather intelligence about illegal traders in a prompt way which would allow it to take action against software pirates  Microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the UK programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries

Ban hits Half Life  pirates hard    About  people have been banned from playing the Half Life  game     Game maker Valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally  Copies of Half Life  had been circulating on file sharing systems soon after it was officially released  Experts said the success of the Half Life  anti piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version     Half Life  was officially released on  November but before gamers could get to grips with the long awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online  Authentication involved setting up an account with Valves gaming community system called Steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run     In a statement detailing the banning of the accounts Valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies   The method used was extremely easy for Valve to trace and confirm and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain Half Life   read the statement  Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all Steam players the  represented  One effect of Steams popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the games ranking in the top ten  Even so the title debuted at No  in the UK charts  Valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen Steam accounts  Some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main Steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account     Some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of Valves anti piracy actions     In its statement Valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake Half Life  keys copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game just to catch pirates and cheats were false  The company said   The hack came from the community as do they all   It added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of Half Life  circulating on file swapping systems such as Bit Torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for CD keys  Rob Fahey editor of online news site gamesindustry biz said the mass banning showed off the power of the Steam system  Before now he said it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played   But with this Valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of Half Life   he said  If Steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum said Mr Fahey other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems   Its not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games  he said  This could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written Steam type systems that are used to batter people with adverts  Unless game firms were careful he said they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play

Smartphones suffer Skulls attack    Owners of some Nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper     Those downloading the software could find all the icons on their  phone swapped for images of skulls  When installed the malicious program also locks many of the  functions making it hard to use and harder to repair  The program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones     The file nicknamed Skulls is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add ons such as wallpaper games and ringtones for their phones Symbian said that it was not sure if the damage Skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming  Soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it  The program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the  phone  The Skulls program is labelled as a file called   extended theme manager zip     Once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications such as contacts calendar notebook etc with non working versions so the phone becomes almost useless  The only thing the phone can do is make and take calls  A statement by Symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it one of which includes ignoring a security warning  Symbian said that the spread of the Skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself  Despite this Finnish anti virus lab F Secure said it had sporadic reports of  owners being caught out by it  The firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again  The Skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias Tee   Symbian phones produced by Sony Ericsson Motorola BenQ Arima and Fujitsu are unaffected by the Skulls program

Musical future for phones    Analyst Bill Thompson has seen the future and it is in his sons hands     I bought my son Max a  phone partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone and partly because I am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought I should see how they work in real life  After using it for a while I am not at all tempted to get rid of my SonyEricsson P smart phone  That has a relatively large screen even if it does only have slower GPRS access to the network  I can read my e mail surf the web using a proper browser and write stuff using the stylus on its touch screen  Last week someone e mailed me a document that had been compressed into a ZIP file and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that my phone even knew how to decompress it for me  By contrast the confusing menus complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of Maxs  phone simply get in the way and I did not see much value in the paid for services especially the limited web access  The videos of entertainment news horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal and I did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image never mind micro TV     But then Max started playing and I realised I was missing the point entirely     It is certainly not a great overall experience but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout  the video content itself is compelling  The quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the BBC website and the image is about the same size  Max was completely captivated and I was intrigued to discover that I had nearly missed the next stage of the network revolution  It is easy to be dismissive of small screens and indeed anyone of my generation with failing eyesight and the view that theres never anything worth watching on TV is hardly going to embrace these phones  But just as the World Wide Web was the  killer application  that drove internet adoption music videos are going to drive  adoption  With Vodafone now pushing its own  service and  already established in the UK video on the phone is clearly going to become a must have for kids sitting on the school bus adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress     This will please the network operators who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired  licences  But it goes deeper than that  playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the download and play model we have all accepted for our iPods and MP players  After all why should I want to carry  of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when I can simply listen to anything I want whenever I want streamed to my phone Oh   and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts something which ensures that it is always in someones pocket or handbag available for other uses too  I have never really approved of using the Internet Protocol IP to do either audio or video streaming and I think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using  voice over IP      But I have to acknowledge that the net at least here in the developed Western countries is fast and reliable enough to do both     I stream radio to my computer while I work and enjoy hearing the bizarre stations from around the world that I can find online but nowhere else  I am even playing with internet telephony despite my reservations and I appear on Go Digital on the World Service streamed over the web each week  But  networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming both for voice and video which gives them an edge over net based IP services  The  services arent quite there yet and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges  Vodafone will let you access its services on Vodafone Live! as part of your subscription cost but it makes you pay by the megabyte to download from other sites   this one for example  This will not matter to business users but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone companys collection of partner sites something that should perhaps be worrying telecoms regulator Ofcom  But we should not see these new phones simply as cut down network terminals  If I want fast access to my e mail I can get a  card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network  The phone is a lot more and it is as a combination of mini TV personal communications device and music video player that it really works  There is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices accessing a wide range of services over different networks   phones and iPods can co exist at least for a while but if I had to bet on the long term I would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket  Or perhaps some enterprising manufacturer will offer me both  An MP player anyone    Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital

Multi purpose TV aids India    Two thirds of the worlds population  billion people live on   a year or less     You might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer  But thats not the case  Many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a TV  And now an Indian born computer engineer thinks hes come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet  Carnegie Mellon Professor Raj Reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people  The first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and Professor Reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might   I come from a village  says Prof Reddy  I know what the population is like many of them are illiterate and many of them have other concerns    There nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a PC word processing and Powerpoint  he said   So its clear to me that if people wanted to use PCs in a village   it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment education telemedicine and access to expert advice      Prof Reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach  After all he asked    what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to  million less fortunate Indians let alone the billions of poor people around the world    Instead Prof Reddy decided to think of those  million Indians as a potential market  The problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough   It must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this  Prof Reddy says   People do this today with television sets  If you go to India and many other countries they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal  Why Because personalized entertainment has become very important   This hatched a completely new idea  He calls it a PCtvt   A personal computer television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine  Literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control     On the screen pictures   not words   designate applications like TV voice mail and video e mail  This dependence on graphics video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs  times more power and more memory than one for a PhD  Prassana Rambathla one of Prof Reddys graduate students says that  when youre talking illiterate youre talking audio and video and that demands exponentially high bandwidth   It cant choke at any point in time and it has to withstand anything no matter what youre pressing    The major part is making it foolproof very tough so that it never breaks  he says  The Carnegie Mellon team says this project is only possible because PCs are now so much cheaper and have built in audio and video hardware and software  Limited trials of the PCtvt are due to start this month in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh     Although Andhra Pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net  Prof Reddy has teamed up with Eric Brewer at the University of California at Berkeley  The answer says Prof Brewer is wi fi      Were looking at the thing youll see in Starbucks or many other hotspots  he says   Were doing a lot of work on long distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency when the power goes up and down and the links go up and down and the computers youre connected to just get turned off for no reason   Prof Reddy says he hopes to lease the PCtvts for about   a month and thinks Indians will rent the units for the television and DVD capabilities  Reddy says he can then introduce the PCtvts other technologies   such as video mail  For example a farmer could use the PCtvts webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer  Prof Reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay off   The underlying problem  he says  is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy and improve their health care   And what Im postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them  If I didnt have it it would be an uphill battle  Even with the technology its an uphill battle  But I have a tool  There is hope  I can reach them in ways that have not been possible before      Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World a BBC World Service and WGBH Boston co production

How to make a gigapixel picture    The largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the Netherlands     The finished image is   billion pixels in size   making it about  times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras  The huge image of Delft was created by stitching together  single snaps of the Dutch city taken at a fixed spot  If printed out in standard  dots per inch resolution the picture would be   high and  long     The researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures  Tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail  The website is already proving popular and currently has more than  visitors every day     The image was created by imaging experts from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO which created the   gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge     The goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images  The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November   That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah and was made up of  separate photographs  The panorama of Delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in Mr Lyons image   He did it all by hand which was an enormous effort and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques it would be feasible to build a larger image  said Jurgen den Hartog one of the TNO researchers behind the project   We were not competing with Mr Lyons but it started as a lunchtime bet      The Dutch team used already available technologies although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high resolution image      We had to rewrite almost all the tools  Me den Hartog told the BBC News website   All standard Windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image so we had to develop one ourselves   The  component pictures were taken on July  by a computer controlled camera with a  mm lens  Each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite  The stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful PCs over three days  Following the success of this project and with promises of help from others the TNO team is considering creating a full  degree panoramic view of another Dutch city with even higher resolution

Remote control rifle range debuts    Soon you could go hunting via the net     A Texas company is considering letting web users use a remote controlled rifle to shoot down deer antelope and wild pigs  For a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a  hectare Texas ranch  The Live Shot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet     John Underwood the man behind the Live Shot website said the idea for the remote control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site   We were looking at a beautiful white tail buck and my friend said If you just had a gun for that  A little light bulb went off in my head  Mr Underwood told the Reuters news agency  A years work and   has resulted in a remote controlled rig on which sits a camera and   calibre rifle  Mr Underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his Texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals  Also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunters can quickly track and aim at passing game animals with the camera and rifle rig  Each remote hunting session will cost   with additional fees for meat processing and taxidermy work  Species that can be shot will include barbary Corsican and mouflon sheep blackbuck antelope and wild pigs  Already the Live Shot site lets people shoot  rounds at paper and silhouette targets for    for each  minute shooting session  For further fees users can get the target they shot and a DVD recording of their session  Handlers oversee each shooting session and can stop the gun being fired if it is being aimed off range or at something it should not be  Mr Underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to Texas  In a statement the RSPCA said it had  grave concerns  about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle   We assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a clean kill something the RSPCA accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport  it said   Animals hit but not killed would without doubt be caused to suffer unnecessarily  said the statement  Mike Berger wildlife director of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting  He said state laws on hunting only covered  regulated animals  such as native deer and bird species  As such there was nothing to stop Mr Underwood letting people hunt  unregulated  imported animals and wild pigs  Mr Underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals

UK broadband gets speed injection    Broadbands rapid rise continues apace as speeds gear up a notch     An eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider UK Online  It is  times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video on demand and broadband TV  The service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use BTs exchanges and will initially only be available in towns     It represents a  big leap forward  for broadband said Chris Stening UK Online general manager     The service comes with a hefty     monthly price tag but will mean users can download MP in seconds and offers TV quality video streaming  The service includes WiFi as standard meaning users can connect multiple PCs laptops and game consoles from any room in the house  Not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas  The service will initially be available to users within  radius of  telephone exchanges in areas such as London Birmingham Glasgow and Cambridge  That represents about   million households  The service is possible due to a decision to loosen BTs strangle hold on telephone exchanges     The process known as local loop unbundling was put in motion by the now defunct telecoms watchdog Oftel but has only proved popular in recent months due to falling costs  UK Online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls video on demand and TV by  if the service proves popular   The service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the UK and  times faster than most broadband services  said Mr Stening   It takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it  he said  Countries such as South Korea and France have found the advantage of upping the speeds of broadband  In South Korea video on demand over the net is cheaper than renting a DVD and online gaming is huge  Mr Stening believes the service will appeal to people in multi occupancy buildings as well as easing family arguments   A typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a  kilobit service  This will basically give them  megabits each  he said

Row brewing over peer to peer ads    Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience     The debate over the legitimacy of file sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good  Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertisers dream come true and a branding nightmare  Paul Myers chief executive of Wippit   a peer to peer service which provides paid for music downloads   believes it is time advertisers stopped providing oxygen for companies that support illegal downloading   You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West Vodafone O First Direct NTL and Renault  he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month     He urged people to follow his lead and dump brands associated with companies such as eDonkey  The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks  Networks like eDonkey Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing  The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue  it said in a statement   Illegal file sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services  We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses  it said  But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers said Mark Mulligan a music analyst with Jupiter Research   This has been a problem for a long time ever since the days of Napster  he told the BBC News website     The reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience   Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience  he said   If you put the legality issues aside not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience  he added  Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing  OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical   We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge  It is not our policy to advertise through peer to peer networks  read a statement from the discount phone firm  It has requested the advert be removed immediately said a spokeswoman  Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites  Since the matter was brought to its attention last month the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites a spokesman told the BBC News website     However Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations  While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends this is no excuse for well known brands he said   I would be surprised if these brands didnt have the know how to prevent this happening  he said  At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well known faces advert on its network   Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world   Senator John Kerry and President George W  Bush  said chief executive Sam Yagan  There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network he thinks   Peer to peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where theyre most comfortable  at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media  he said

How to smash a home computer    An executive who froze his broken hard disk thinking it would be fixed has topped a list of the weirdest computer mishaps     Although computer malfunctions remain the most common cause of file loss data recovery experts say human behaviour still is to blame in many cases  They say that no matter how effective technology is at rescuing files users should take more time to back up and protect important files  The list of the top  global data disasters was compiled by recovery company Ontrack     Careless   and preventable   mistakes that result in data loss range from reckless file maintenance practices to episodes of pure rage towards a computer  This last category includes the case of a man who became so mad with his malfunctioning laptop that he threw it in the lavatory and flushed a couple of times   Data can disappear as a result of natural disaster system fault or computer virus but human error including computer rage seems to be a growing problem  said Adrian Palmer managing director of Ontrack Data Recovery      Nevertheless victims soon calm down when they realise the damage theyve done and come to us with pleas for help to retrieve their valuable information   A far more common situation is when a computer virus strikes and leads to precious files being corrupted or deleted entirely  Mr Palmer recalled the case of a couple who had hundreds of pictures of their babys first three months on their computer but managed to reformat the hard drive and erase all the precious memories   Data can be recovered from computers servers and even memory cards used in digital devices in most cases  said Mr Palmer   However individuals and companies can avoid the hassle and stress this can cause by backing up data on a regular basis

Mobile picture power in your pocket    How many times have you wanted to have a camera to hand to catch an unexpected event that would make headlines    With a modern mobile phone that has a camera built in you no longer need to curse you can capture the action as it happens  Already on the spot snappers are helping newspapers add immediacy to their breaking news stories headlines where professional photographers only arrive in time for the aftermath  Celebrities might not welcome such a change because they may never be free of a new breed of mobile phone paparazzi making their lives a bit more difficult  Already one tabloid newspaper in LA is issuing photographers with camera phones to help them catch celebrities at play  It could be the start of a trend that only increases as higher resolution phone cameras become more widespread  as video phones catch on and millions of people start carrying the gadgets around     Only last week the world media highlighted the killing of the Dutch film maker Theo van Gogh notorious after making a controversial film about Islamic culture     One day later De Telegraaf a daily Amsterdam newspaper became news on its own when it published a picture taken with a mobile phone of Mr van Goghs body moments after he was killed   This picture was the story  said De Telegraafs image editor Peter Schoonen  Other accounts of such picture phone users witnessing news events include          A flight from Switzerland to the Dominican Republic which turned around after someone took a picture of a piece of metal falling from the plane as it took off from Zurich reported by the Swiss daily Le Matin       Two crooks who robbed a bank in Denmark were snapped before they carried out the crime waiting for the doors of the building to be opened reported by the Danish regional paper Aarhus Stiftstidende         But this is not just about traditional media lending immediacy to their stories with content from ordinary people it is also about first hand journalism in the form of online diaries or weblogs     It has been called  open source news  or even  moblog journalism  and it has flourished in the recent US election campaign   Not many people walk around with their cameras but they always have their mobile phones with them  If something happens suddenly all these mobiles sort of appear from nowhere and start taking pictures  said digital artist Henry Reichhold  He himself uses mobile phone pictures to create huge panoramic images of events and places   You see it in bars you see it everywhere  Its a massive thing  Mr Reichhold told the BBC News website     With some picture agencies already paying for exclusive phone pictures especially of celebrities there are also fears about the possible downside of this phenomenon     It could become a nuisance for public figures as higher resolution picture phones hit the market with five megapixel models already being launched in Asia  Already on US photojournal site Buzznet there is a public album full of snaps of celebrities many of which were taken with camera phones  Tabloid newspapers in the UK and many monthly magazines invite readers to send in images of famous people they have seen and snapped  But there are other positive uses of picture mobile phones that may balance these uses  For instance in Alabama in the US camera phones will be used to take snaps at crime scenes involving children and help the authorities to arrest and prosecute paedophiles  And in Chinas capital Beijing courts have adopted mobile phone photos as formal evidence  For Henry Reichhold this is progress   Thats the whole thing about the immediacy of the thing  I can see that happening a lot more

Toxic web links help virus spread    Virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares     A Windows virus called Bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code  Those clicking on the poisoned links in e mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus  The trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti virus software that combs through code contained in e mail attachments     The virus that uses this trick is called Bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on  November  They exploit a Windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier     Like many other recent viruses Bofra plunders the address book in Microsoft Outlook for e mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses  The virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e mail messages to potential victims but unlike many other recent viruses does not itself travel via mail  Instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that when clicked on connect back to the machine that distributed that e mail  Essentially Bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus  The messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a Paypal transaction     Copies of the messages seen by the BBC News website had bright yellow and green backgrounds  Those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the Bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to  Filtering firm Clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down  In the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines  Shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading     Clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e mail messages sent out by machines infected by Bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread  Finnish anti virus firm F Secure said that so far it had not seen many copies of the Bofra virus and its variants in circulation     Tim Warner spokesman for anti virus firm Finjan said   You have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating   Mr Warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code   Most firms have secured their e mail gateway  said Mr Warner  but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways   He said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims  The Bofra family of viruses which were originally thought to be offshoots of the MyDoom bug can infect machines running Windows    Me NT XP and Server   Users running Windows XP that have applied the SP update are not vulnerable to the loophole that Bofra exploits

Millions to miss out on the net    By    of the UKs population will still be without internet access at home says a study     Around  million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information predicts the report by telecoms giant BT  It compares to  million or   of the UK who are not currently online  The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is  wishful thinking  the report concludes     The study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution  Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more the report suggests  As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access it predicts     The gap between  have nets  and  have nots  has been much talked about but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed  BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing  Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark the report suggests   Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it  said Adrian Hosford director of corporate responsibility at BT  Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological   There is a hard rump of have nots who are not engaging with the net  They dont have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits  said Mr Hosford     As now the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families the older generation and the disabled     Those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have nots the disabled will make up   and the elderly nearly a third by  the report forecasts  Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem said Mr Hosford  The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain  In one area of Cornwall with high levels of unemployment online training helped people rewrite CVs and learn skills to get new jobs explained Mr Hosford  Such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome he said   If we dont address this problem now it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs education opportunities will be limited and theyll simply not be able to keep up with society  he said  The Alliance for Digital Inclusion an independent body with members drawn from government industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks

Lifestyle governs mobile choice    Faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests     Instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake  Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an in depth study by handset maker Ericsson   Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology  said Dr Michael Bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at Ericssons consumer and enterprise lab   We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives  he said   We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing  he told the BBC News website     For the study Ericsson interviewed  mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone   Peoples habits remain the same  said Dr Bjorn   They just move the activity into the mobile phone as its a much more convenient way to do it      One good example of this was diary writing among younger people he said  While diaries have always been popular a mobile phone    especially one equipped with a camera    helps them keep it in a different form  Youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way  Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles  Ericssons research has shown that consumers divide into different  tribes  that use phones in different ways  Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed  pioneers  and  materialists  were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use   For instance  he said  older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago   This was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch     Another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists  Only when about   of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it     Once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off  Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop  However he said now   of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month  In  the figure was    Similarly across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise  In  only   of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month  Now the figure is    Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations  Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras   Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras  he said  Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays  By contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life

Search sites get closer to users    Search sites want to get to know you better     Not content with providing access to the millions of websites many now offer ways that do a better job of remembering cataloguing and managing all the information you come across  Some of the latest to update their search systems are Ask Jeeves and Blinkx which have both released a series of utilities that try to help people get more from the web   The future is all about developing your own personal web  said Tony Macklin spokesman for Ask Jeeves     Mr Macklin said that too often when people use a search engine it was like the first time they ever used it because there was no memory of what they had searched for before   Each time you go back in you have to start all over again  he said  The series of updates to its service collected under the My Ask Jeeves banner would help people remember where they had been before     Ask Jeeves has added the ability to  save  websites of interest so the next time a users visits the site they can search through the sites they have previously found  Sites saved in this way can be arranged in folders and have notes attached to them to explain why they were saved  Mr Macklin said many people wanted to save sites they had seen but did not want to add them to their bookmarks or favourites not least because such lists cannot be easily searched  On average said Mr Macklin users conduct between five and  searches per day and the tools in My Ask Jeeves should stop them having to do searches twice and get to what they want much more easily  Under My Ask Jeeves users can search the web or through the results they have already noted as interesting   Its about finding again what you found before  he said  The My Ask Jeeves service lets people store up to a  web links or  if they sign up to the free service  By way of comparison Googles Desktop search tool catalogues search histories informally and lets people look through the sites they have visited     At the same time search start up Blinkx has released a second version of its eponymous software  Blinkx is desktop search software that watches what someone is working on be it a document or e mail and suggests websites video clips blogs or documents on a PC that are relevant to it     Since Blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as Google Copernic Enfish X and Apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their PC as well as the web   The competition has validated the problem we tackle  said Suranga Chandratillake co founder of Blinkx  In the latest release of Blinkx the company has added what it calls smart folders  Once created the folders act as persistent queries that automatically sweep the web for pages related to their subject and catalogues relevant information documents or incoming e mails on hard drives too  What users do with Blinkx and other desktop search engines shows that people tend to be very promiscuous in their use of search engines   Blinkx users do not stop using other web search systems  he said   They might use Google to look up a company or Yahoo for travel because they know they are good at that  he said   The classic thing we have seen recently is people using Blinkx to look at the things they have searched on  he said  The variety of ways to search data was only helping users said Mr Chandratillake and that it was likely that in the future people would use different ones for different tasks

Anti spam screensaver scrapped    A contentious campaign to bump up the bandwidth bills of spammers by flooding their sites with data has been dropped     Lycos Europes Make Love Not Spam campaign began in late November but its tactics proved controversial  Lycos has shut down the campaign saying it had been started to stimulate debate about anti spam measures and had now achieved this aim  The anti spammer screensaver came under fire for encouraging vigilante activity and skirting the edge of the law     Through the Make Love Not Spam website users could download a screensaver that would endlessly request data from the net sites mentioned in many junk mail messages  More than  people are thought to have downloaded the screensaver that Lycos Europe offered     The company wanted to keep the spam sites running at near total capacity to make it much less financially attractive to spammers to operate the sites  But the campaign was controversial from the moment it kicked off and many net veterans criticised it for using spamming type tactics against the senders of junk mail  Some net service firms began blocking access to the Lycos Europe site in protest at the action  Monitoring firm Netcraft found that the anti spam campaign was proving a little too successful  According to response time figures gathered by Netcraft some of the sites that the screensaver targeted were being knocked offline by the constant data requests  In a statement from Lycos Europe announcing the scrapping of the scheme the company denied that this was its fault   There is nothing to suggest that Make Love Not Spam has brought down any of the sites that it has targeted  it said   At the time that Netcraft measured the sites it claims may have been brought down they were not in fact part of the Make Love Not Spam attack cycle  it added  The statement issued by Lycos also said that the centralised database it used ensured that traffic to the target sites left them with   spare capacity   The idea was simply to slow spammers sites and this was achieved by the campaign  the company said  Many security organisations said users should not participate in the Lycos Europe campaign  The closure comes only days after the campaign was suspended following the outbreak of criticism

Europe backs digital TV lifestyle    How people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change following the launch of an ambitious European project     In Nice last week the European Commission announced its Networked   Electronic Media NEM initiative  Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created through each of the stages of its distribution to its playback  The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly when on the move at home or at work no matter who supplies the devices network content or content protection scheme  More than  experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia Intel Philips Alcatel France Telecom Thomson and Telefonica  It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together  But again and again speakers stated they could not see incompatible stand alone solutions working  A long term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required     The European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach  They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses  The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline pick out the best bring them together and identify where the gaps are  Where it finds holes it will develop standards to fill them  What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget  This is bound to please if not surprise many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer  Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management DRM schemes  Currently DRM solutions are incompatible locking certain types of purchased content making them unplayable on all platforms  With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally the prize for being the supplier of the worlds dominant DRM scheme is huge  Although entertainment is an obvious first step it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare energy efficiency and control of the smart home  The  year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the EC has been funding for a number of years     Simon Perry is the editor of the Digital Lifestyles website which covers the impact of technology on media

TV future in the hands of viewers    With home theatre systems plasma high definition TVs and digital video recorders moving into the living room the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years time     That is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes  With the US leading the trend programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks through cable satellite telecoms companies and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices     One of the most talked about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders DVR and PVR  These set top boxes like the USs TiVo and the UKs Sky  system allow people to record store play pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want     Essentially the technology allows for much more personalised TV  They are also being built in to high definition TV sets which are big business in Japan and the US but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high definition programming  Not only can people forward wind through adverts they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules putting together their own a la carte entertainment  But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as  brand identity  and viewer loyalty to channels  Although the US leads in this technology at the moment it is also a concern that is being raised in Europe particularly with the growing uptake of services like Sky    What happens here today we will see in nine months to a years time in the UK  Adam Hume the BBC Broadcasts futurologist told the BBC News website  For the likes of the BBC there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet  It is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial UK broadcasters but brand loyalty is important for everyone   We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands  said Tim Hanlon from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest   The reality is that with broadband connections anybody can be the producer of content   He added   The challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice      What this means said Stacey Jolna senior vice president of TV Guide TV group is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers  It means that networks in US terms or channels could take a leaf out of Googles book and be the search engine of the future instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch  This kind of channel model might work for the younger iPod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them  But it might not suit everyone the panel recognised  Older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting  They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands Mr Hanlon suggested   On the other end you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already   everything is possible and available to them  said Mr Hanlon   Ultimately the consumer will tell the market they want      Of the  new gadgets and technologies being showcased at CES many of them are about enhancing the TV watching experience  High definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD Liquid Crystal Display TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them instead of being external boxes  One such example launched at the show is Humaxs  inch LCD TV with an  hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder  One of the USs biggest satellite TV companies DirectTV has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with  hours of recording capability instant replay and a search function  The set can pause and rewind TV for up to  hours  And Microsoft chief Bill Gates announced in his pre show keynote speech a partnership with TiVo called TiVoToGo which means people can play recorded programmes on Windows PCs and mobile devices  All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want when they want

Cyber criminals step up the pace    So called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in  say security experts     The number of phishing e mail messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than  months  In  it detected more than  million phishing e mail messages  Other statistics show that in    of all e mail was spam and one in  messages were infected with a virus     In its end of year report MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals  In September  MessageLabs caught only  phishing e mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations  But by September  it was stopping more than two million phishing related e mail messages per month  Worryingly said the firm phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data     Older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake but more recent phishing e mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened  Other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards   E mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity  said Mark Sunner chief technology officer at MessageLabs   In just  months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online  he said  Mr Sunner said MessageLabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation   Already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed indicating a shift from the random scattergun approach to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses  he said  Although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout  viruses and spam remain popular with cyber criminals and vandals  One of the biggest outbreaks took place in January when the MyDoom virus started circulating  To date the company has caught more than  million copies of the virus  Also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation  In  only   of messages were spam  But by the end of  almost three quarters of messages were junk

Gritty return for Prince of Persia    Still basking in the relatively recent glory of last years Sands Of Time the dashing Prince of Persia is back in Warrior Within and in a more bellicose mood than last time     This sequel gives the franchise a grim gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence  As before you control the super athletic prince from a third person perspective  The time travelling plot hinges on the Dahaka an all consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages  The only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry Empress Of Time before she ever creates the Sands of Time that caused the great beasts creation     Studiously structured though this back story is everything boils down to old fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves on the whole as dependable as it needs to be  Ever since the series then groundbreaking beginnings on the Commodore Amiga Prince of Persia has always been about meticulously animated acrobatic moves that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies body parts     Those flashy moves are back in full evidence and tremendous fun to perform and perfect  Combining them at speed is the best fun although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill  Until you reach that point it is a haphazard business  All too often you will perform a stunning triple somersault pirouette off a wall knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom  That in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path  The expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct but combat is what is really been stepped up and there is more of it than before  The games developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways  Slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off     Warrior Within is a very slick package  the games intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences     It is on a par with the jaw dropping opening sequence of Onimusha  earlier this year and when the game begins it is something of an anti climax  That said the graphics are excellent and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game  The music is probably the worst aspect   a merit free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off  There is something strangely unsatisfying about the game  Perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be  Somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable  But that is not to say Warrior Within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy  It just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for

Halo  heralds traffic explosion    The growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms warns network monitoring company Sandvine     It issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the Xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of Halo   The  November traffic explosion has continued into December said Sandvine  Service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth  As well as being a popular single player title Halo  can be connected to Microsofts subscription based broadband network Xbox Live  Gamers who want to play online can create their own clan or team and take on others to see how well they compare     But the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic said Sandvines chief technology officer Marc Morin     In a bid to cope and ease congestion providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent finding out who is using bandwidth and for what  It could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use   The explosion in Xbox Live traffic attributed to Halo  should be seen as a clarion call  he said   ISPs need to enhance the broadband experience for these high end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games  he added     One of the main factors that spoils online gaming is  lag  in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world  Gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest  lag   Analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth hungry gamers said Lindsay Schroth an analyst with research firm The Yankee Group   In the competitive broadband environment operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live play gaming  she said  In countries such as Korea which has high levels of fast net connections to homes online gaming is hugely popular

Media gadgets get moving    Pocket sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in  according to industry experts     Last year saw the emergence of portable media players such as the Windows based Creative Zen portable media player the Samsung Yepp the iRiver PMC  and the Archos AV series among others  But this year they are set to get smarter and more connected to allow people to find more video to watch on them  Archos launched its latest range of its Linux based portable media devices at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Friday  Dubbed the Pocket Media Assistant PMA it crucially has wi fi capability built in for the first time   Consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access  said Henri Crohas chief of Archos   And now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time   Archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in peoples pockets after the mobile     Unlike Windows based players the Archos AV series devices have always been able to record from any video source such as TVs as well as playback  The content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device     Recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it  And wi fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high speed wireless link  Archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to Linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device  Microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at CES primarily for US consumers though  It has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company TiVo which Bill Gates also showcased in his keynote speech at CES  The TiVo To Go service means that US consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their TiVos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the Windows based portable media players or smartphones  It also said it had launched a service with MTV to let people watch Comedy Central VH and Country Music TV on its devices  And a service is launching with MSN to provide people with shortened versions of news entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the PC onto the portable devices  But the ability to record directly from TV VCR and digital cable and satellite boxes which Windows based devices do not offer certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too     The increased capability of these devices and the content deals that are being done may go some way to persuading people to use them  Recent research by Jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music  Only   of Europeans wanted to watch video while on the move  More seemed interested in spending their cash on music only devices      This year we are ready for an explosion of portable media  Microsofts Mike Coleman told the BBC News website   We are very bullish about it  The fact that I can put photos on here too and share them is super cool to the consumer  he added  The fact that Europeans are far larger public transport users than Americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too  There is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work  Although Microsofts content distribution deals are for the US market at the moment talks were  always on going  with European content suppliers to offer similar services  Various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however  But that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices particularly via those which are wi fi enabled  The possibility is open for non professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work  CES which runs from  to  January showcases more than  new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in

Satellite mapping aids Darfur relief    Aid workers trying to house feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the Sudanese region of Darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology     A European consortium of companies and university groups known as Respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps  The aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed  Respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly   Respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks for the rivers and for the villages to more large scale maps useful for very general planning purposes  said Einar Bjorgo from Unosat the UN satellite mapping organisation that is part of the Respond consortium     The group uses satellites from Nasa the European Space Agency and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation  The satellite data is transmitted to ground stations  From there the information makes its way to Respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data   You have to convert the data into images then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis damage or situation maps  said Stefan Voigt who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations the German Aerospace Centre     This kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but Respond gets it done in about  hours   Our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery reading satellite maps so its our task to transfer the data into information that non technical people can read and understand easily and very very efficiently  said Mr Voigt  Respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web and on compact disc  But the best map is one you can hold in your hands especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce   A map is a working document  explains Herbert Hansen of Responds Belgian partner Keyobs   You need to use it you need to write on it correct give feedback and so on so you need paper to write on   We print maps we laminate the maps we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map its completely protected      Humanitarian groups in Darfur have been making good use of Responds maps  They have come in especially handy during Sudans rainy season when normally dry riverbeds or wadis became flooded   These wadis had a very small amount of flooding generally in terms of depth but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground  says Stephen Candillon of Respond imaging partner Sertit  Responds rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times  Aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on the ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it     Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World a BBC World Service and WGBH Boston co production

Lifestyle governs mobile choice    Faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests     Instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake  Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an in depth study by telecommunications company Ericsson   Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology  said Dr Michael Bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at Ericssons consumer and enterprise lab   We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives  he said   We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing  he told the BBC News website     For the study Ericsson interviewed  mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone   Peoples habits remain the same  said Dr Bjorn   They just move the activity into the mobile phone as its a much more convenient way to do it      One good example of this was diary writing among younger people he said  While diaries have always been popular a mobile phone    especially one equipped with a camera    helps them keep it in a different form  Youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way  Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles  Ericssons research has shown that consumers divide into different  tribes  that use phones in different ways  Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed  pioneers  and  materialists  were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use   For instance  he said  older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago   This was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch     Another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists  Only when about   of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it     Once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off  Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop  However he said now   of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month  In  the figure was    Similarly across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise  In  only   of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month  Now the figure is    Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations  Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras   Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras  he said  Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays  By contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life

More power to the people says HP    The digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories according to Carly Fiorina chief of technology giant Hewlett Packard     The job of firms such as HP now she said in a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show CES was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged  She said the goal for  was to make people the centre of technology  CES showcases  new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in   The tech fest the largest of its kind in the world runs from  to  January   The digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible  she told delegates   Revolution has always been about giving power to the people   She added   The real story of the digital revolution is not just new products but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell   Part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content such as images video and music  Crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device such as a digital camera to others such as portable media players  A lot of work still needs to be done however to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly she said     Ms Fiorinas talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle fashion and personalisation something she sees as key to what people want     Special guest singer Gwen Stefani joined her on stage to promote her own range of HP digital cameras which Ms Stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by Japanese youth culture  The digital cameras which are due to go on sale in the US by the summer are based on the HP  model  The emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this years CES with tiny wearable MP players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything  Ms Fiorina also announced that HP was working with Nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles which would launch in Europe early this year  The service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content like a tracks ringtone simultaneously  The service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive     Among the other new products she showcased was the Digital Media Hub a big upgrade to HPs Digital Entertainment Centre  Coming out in the autumn in the US the box is a networked high definition TV cable set top box digital video recorder and DVD recorder  It has a removable hard drive cartridge memory card slots and Light Scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised DVD labels and covers  It is designed to contain all a households digital media such as pre recorded TV shows pictures videos and music so it can all be managed in one place  The hub reflects the increasing move to re box the PC so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment  Research suggests that about  million images are saved and shared every day equating to  billion a year  Eighty per cent of those remain on cameras  Media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box  Ms Fiorina was one of several keynote speakers who also included Microsoft chief Bill Gates to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next  months  In a separate announcement during the keynote speech Ms Fiorina said that HP would be partnering MTV to replace this years MTV Asia music award  MTVs Asia Aid will be held in Bangkok on  February and is aimed at helping to raise money for the Asian tsunami disaster

Robotic pods take on car design    A new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by Japanese car giant Toyota     The companys vision for the single passenger in the  Century involves the driver cruising by in a four wheeled leaf like device or strolling along encased in an egg shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet  Both these prototypes will be demonstrated along with other concept vehicles and helper robots at the Toyota stand at the Expo  in Aichi Japan in March   The models are being positioned as so called personal mobility devices which have few limits  The open leaf like  i unit  vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year  Built using environmentally friendly plant based materials the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes  The model allows the user to make tight on the spot turns move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds  Body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music     Also on display at the show will be the egg shaped  i foot   This is a two legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick     Standing at a height of well over seven feet   metres the unit can walk along at a speed of about   h   and navigate staircases into the bargain  Mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird like legs that bend over backwards   They are clearly what we call concept vehicles innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production  said Dr David Gillingwater from the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University   They clearly have eye catching appeal which is in part the name of the game here and are linked to the iMac and iPod type niche which Apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years   new different hi tech image conscious products   As always with these concept vehicles it is difficult to see who they would appeal to and what their role would be in the personal transport marketplace      The personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities  Toyotas prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport  Powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much US military research over the years and Japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications  With an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population care giving and the military wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individuals particular mobility needs  While Toyotas prototypes are geared towards mass transport the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility     Experts though are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area      Those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance now and certainly in the future are the elderly and infirm people  Dr Gillingwater told the BBC News website   You have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups   Design considerations also exist  Dr Erel Avineri of the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England in Bristol said   The design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled   For example one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up   It looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need  This and other human factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered  said Dr Avineri   In general introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades  Elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation   This may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle   Such single person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport   The concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions  said Dr Gillingwater   Whats their range How user friendly will they really be What infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used   Overall I think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions

Mobile multimedia slow to catch on    There is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular  Consumers swapping old phones for slinkier dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a   increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of  according to analysts Gartner More than  million handsets were sold between July and September  a period that according to Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi is  seldom strong   But although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps sounds and video clips few so far are taking the chance to do so     In fact the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures audio and video is growing  Figures gathered by Continental Research shows that   of British camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message MMS up from   in   This is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the UK more than doubled to   million  Getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying  The problem they face said Shailendra Jain head of MMS firm Adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets      Also  he said  they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it   Research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to  According to Continental Research   of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation  Only   regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message  The fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to peoples reluctance to start sending them said Mr Jain   They ask themselves  If Im streaming video from one handset to another will it work  he said   Theres a lot of user apprehension about that      There are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might  Andrew Bud executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system   The rate we can send MMS into the mobile network is fairly constant  he said  The reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users     No one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of MMS messages is capped said Mr Bud  This has led to operators finding other technologies particularly one known as Wap push to get multimedia to their customers  But when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers the results can be dramatic  Israeli technology firm Celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth  One of the first firms to use the Celltick service is Hutch India the largest mobile firm in the country  The broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems  While not multimedia messaging such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content  As a result   of the subscribers to the Hutch Alive which uses Cellticks broadcast technology regularly click for more pictures sounds and images from the operator   Operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers  said Yaron Toren spokesman for Celltick  Until then multimedia will be a message that is not getting through

PC photo printers challenge pros    Home printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from High Street developers tests shows     A survey carried out by PC Pro magazine looked at which of  home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab  The tests found that images from top PC printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs  But using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months warned the magazine     The group test of  home photo printers for PCs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as High Street names such as Jessops Boots and Snappy Snaps  The comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage  It found that although some ink for printers now costs more than    per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a High Street store   If you really like your photos then its definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street but only if you choose the right printer  said Nick Ross top tester at PC Pro     Mr Ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many High Street developers or even some professional wedding photographers  Some High Street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were  said Mr Ross but the test revealed that images  and  in size were cheaper to produce at home  According to PC Pro producing a print  on an Epson R printer using top quality paper costs      At Jessops the same image would cost     and at Snappy Snaps      A  snap at Boots would cost       Considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the High Street and how silver halide prints can fade in the sun were adamant that its now better cheaper and more convenient to print at home  he said  Ann Simpson marketing manager at Snappy Snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers   Some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one  she said   Many people are not skilled at getting the colour contrast and cropping right and they dont want the hassle  she added  The magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading  It recommended avoiding so called third party inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest

Bond game fails to shake or stir    For gaming fans the word GoldenEye evokes excited memories not only of the James Bond revival flick of  but also the classic shoot em up that accompanied it and left N owners glued to their consoles for many an hour     Adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the originals massive sense of fun  This however is not a sequel nor does it relate to the GoldenEye film  You are the eponymous renegade spy an agent who deserts to the Bond worlds extensive ranks of criminal masterminds after being deemed too brutal for MI  Your new commander in chief is the portly Auric Goldfinger last seen in  but happily running around bent on world domination  With a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of Tina Turners similarly titled theme song the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury which enables a degree of X ray vision     Rogue Agent signals its intentions by featuring James Bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments squashed by a plummeting helicopter  The notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a  game but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to     Recent Bond games like Nightfire and Everything Or Nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair invention and glamour of the film franchise  This title lacks that aura and when the Bond magic shines through it feels like a lucky accident  The central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough  Quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy AI the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination  Admittedly the competition has been tough even in recent weeks with the likes of Halo  and Half Life  triumphing in virtually every department  What the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy dynamic scenes of violent chaos  As is the trend of late you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter  Sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos meaning that frustration is often the outcome  And irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed  A minute red dot passes for a crosshair although the collision detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for  Shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky and you will not always know you have picked them off since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations  It is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game makers allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights   no time is risked with a measured build up     By far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like Dr No Goldfinger hat fiend Oddjob and crazed Russian sex beast Xenia Onatopp resurrected after all these years and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion     There is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains and it is a testament to the power of the Bond universe that they can cut such a dash  But the in game niggles combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought through will make this a disappointment for most  Diehard fans of Bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings  The game is weak not completely unplayable  Then again  fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras  Given James Bonds healthy pedigree in past games there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip a commendable idea that just has not worked that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return     GoldenEye  Rogue Agent is out now

Poles play with GameBoy blip pop    A group of artists in Poland has taken the cacophony of blips boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on Nintendos handheld GameBoy console to a new level     The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed  blip pop   Think of it as Donkey Kong meets Norman Cook or maybe Tetris takes on Kraftwerk  Any way you slice it the sound is distinct  All the sounds are made by six Nintendo GameBoys with a mixture of older models and newer Advance SP handhelds  The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project tweaks the software a bit and then connects the units through a mixing board     Jarek Kujda one of the projects founding members has been into electronic music and video games for a while now      I was playing some experimental music and three four years ago when I first used a GameBoy in my band as a drum machine  said Kujda  He realised that the console could be used as a rudimentary synthesizer  He wondered if one GameBoy can make music what would happen if he put six of them together Kujda found five other people who were interested and the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project was born   Gameboyzz Orchestra Project is more of an improvisational project  said Kudja   We prepare some patterns before a concert and then improvise during the concert   The group plays maybe four or five shows a year  Malgorzata Kujda Jareks younger sister and a fellow band member describes a Gameboyzz Orchestra Project concert as a lot of noise   For example I make music with more hard beats and noises  she said   But each of us makes another music a different sound  And then in the concert we just improvise and that I think is more fun for us      The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences  Some love the groups music and others are not quite sure what to make of it     In the world of electronic music these purveyors of blip pop are not unique  But Jarek Kujda says they try to be unique   We have lots of people making music on old school stuff electronic old school stuff like Commodore Atari Spectrum  he said   We want to play only experimental music not cover songs  Were something like an electronic jam session   The Gameboyzz Orchestra Projects tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a CD next year  And they have sponsorship courtesy of the Polish distributor of Nintendo products  The members of the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project do not expect serious competition anytime soon  A GameBoy Advance costs about US   in Poland these days which is still way beyond the reach of most Polish gamers or musicians     Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World a BBC World Service and WGBH Boston co production

EU software patent law delayed    Controversial new EU rules for the patenting of computer based inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from Poland     Poland   a large and therefore crucial EU member   has requested more time to consider the issue especially as it relates to the patenting of software  Critics say the law would favour large companies over small innovative ones  They say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software     Polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software  The planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the EU should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the US  So for instance US based Amazon com holds a patent on one click shopping  Critics claim the law which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US is little more than a law on ideas   Patent rights it is claimed protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected  Eva Lichtenberg a Austrian Green member of the European Parliament said in a statement   Smaller innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them  she added  The European Parliament has already clashed with the European Union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic  The directive has been subject to several previous delays

Speech takes on search engines    A Scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results     Called Speegle it has the look and feel of a normal search engine with the added feature of being able to read out the results  Scottish speech technology firm CEC Systems launched the site in November  But experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments     The Edinburgh based firm CEC has married speech technology with ever popular internet search  The ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web     According to search engine Ask Jeeves around   of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net  People visiting Speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the BBC and Reuters   It is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad  said Speegle founder Gordon Renton   The system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else   We are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people although the Royal National Institute of the Blind RNIB is looking at the technology  he added  But Julie Howell digital policy manager at the RNIB expressed doubts over whether Speegle and similar sites added anything to blind peoples experience of the web   There are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be  she said   Blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way  she added     The site uses a technology dubbed PanaVox which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech  In the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but CEC says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial up connections  Visitors to Speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known if silent search engine Google  Google has no connection with Speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments said Mr Renton   It is not a rip off  We are doing something that Google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery  he said  Speegle is proving popular with those learning English in countries such as Japan and China   The site is bombarded by people just listening to the words  The repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots  said Mr Renton

Napster offers rented music to go    Music downloading for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services can be a costly business     The cost of paying even as little as  per track can add up particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs  Paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient and ultimately cheaper way of owning music      Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle  either single tracks or subscriptions services  said Paul Myers chief executive of Wippit a UK based music download service  While iTunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to iPod owners others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age  Napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service   dubbed Napster to Go in the UK in the next few months  The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus  This includes players made by Samsung Rio and Creative     Currently on offer in beta version in the US the service costs   per month for unlimited downloads  The technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service  Users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play     This has outraged some digital music lovers especially as Napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the PC  Napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to go service and says it also offers  greater value  for customers  Mr Myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers   Weve been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want  Format interoperability excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from Wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose  he said   Who wants to download a track that wont play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone  Wippit offers a download subscription service for     per month or    per year  It has a catalogue of around  songs

Broadband soars in     If broadband were a jumbo jet then  would have seen it taxiing down the runway firing up its engines and preparing for take off  But this year has seen it soar     In the spring it literally took to the skies as Lufthansa and British Airways trialled it on flights  This perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology rather than how useful sky high broadband would actually be  It was flying high and by the autumn five million Britons had signed up for high speed net access at home     Such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million or more than   of homes  The two key factors in whetting peoples appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push  When operators such as BT and Telewest offered standard  broadband for less than    at the beginning of the year it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached   broadband had truly gone mass market  A feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market take up of dial up  Broadband for less than    was even touted by some firms although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models     For those who became broadbanders in  there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities  The rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access to the tune of  million connections worldwide by April prompting research firm Point Topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever  By September the number of broadband connections in the UK finally overtook dial up and in December BT announced that it was making a new broadband connection every  seconds     Broadband was being mentioned on the  Oclock News and in the tabloids  the Sun even carried a cartoon joke about it  But two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines  In May BT quietly announced that it was shaving   off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges so called local loop unbundling  The vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes  At the moment BT has a stranglehold on more than   of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what ADSL products get into homes  With cheaper local loop unbundling rivals to BT can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise like  It will mean the UK will finally catch up with countries such as France and the Netherlands where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to  megabits per second  And the major price fall means that rather than just talk about it companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into BTs exchanges  It may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the Northern Ireland peace talks   fraught bitter and with no end in sight     Another big piece of news for broadband users in  was the extension of BTs reach meaning more than   of the population could get broadband regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived     There was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to  broadband they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband enabled exchange  For thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology the news meant they could finally join in  Broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators NTL and Telewest also had a bumper year  The biggest news for them was increased speeds introducing  and  services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on   The cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route  Broadband can seem confusing for consumers with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set up fees  It is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in  but remains a plane worth catching  As it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride

Blinx sequel purrs nicely    The original Blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to Microsofts then new Xbox console     Its sharp graphics and novel gameplay with the main character able to pause slow rewind and fast forward time were meant to lure many fans to the new machine  But poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half way through a level without the required tools to finish  Thankfully the sequel has fixed many of the original faults  This time around you do not play as Blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters     The character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game     As the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions pig and feline assuming the role of your created characters  The thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing Time Crystal  As in the original your feline persona can control time but this time the pigs get to control space  There are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps space bubbles and void traps in order to progress  The control over space and time is achieved through a number of VCR style icons and is quite intuitive     Annoyingly the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them  The game has also tried to emulate franchises such as Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank on PS and so there are a number of combat elements  These are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair  But the games excellent graphics easily the best looking platform game around sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans     Blinx  is out on Xbox now

The year search became personal    The odds are that when you fire up your browser you go straight to your favourite search engine rather than type in a web address     Some may see this as the height of laziness but in an era of information overload search has become a vital tool in navigating the net  It is symptomatic of how the way we use the internet is changing  And as Google has shown there is money in offering a service that people cannot live without  There is no shortage of companies vying for the loyalty of web searchers offering a wealth of different services and tools to help you find what you want  Over the past  months giants of the technology world such as Microsoft and Yahoo have sought to grab a slice of the search action   User experience has contributed to people searching more  said Yonca Brunini of Yahoo  As people become more familiar with the internet they tend to spend more time online and ask more queries she said   The other second thing is broadband  Ms Brunini told the BBC News website   This will do to internet what colour has done to TV      But search is hardly a new phenomenon  It has been around since the early days of the net     Veteran surfers will remember old timers like Hotbot and Altavista   Search was always important  said Urs Holzle Google vice president of operations   We trumpeted that in   It is even truer now as there are more users and more information    People didnt realise that search was the future  The financials have something to do with it   Google has shown web commerce can work through its targeted small adverts which appear at the top and down the right hand side of a page and are related to the original search  These small ads helped Google reach revenues of    for the three months to September  Others have woken up to the fact that you can make money out of web queries   Once you see there is a market Microsoft is bound to step to it  If Microsoft sees search as important then nobody queries it  said Mr Holzle     Microsoft is just one of the net giants muscling in on search  Yahoo Ask Jeeves Amazon and a handful of smaller outfits are all seeking to capture eyeballs     Web users face a plethora of choices as each company tries to outflank Google by rolling out new search products such as desktop search  It reflects how the battlefield has shifted from the net to your PC  Search is not just about finding your way around the web  It is now about unlocking information hidden in the gigabytes of documents images and music on hard drives  For all these advances search is still a clumsy tool often failing to come up with exactly what you had in mind  In order to do a better job search engines are trying to get to know you better doing a better job of remembering cataloguing and managing all the information you come across   Personalisation is going to be a big area for the future  said Yahoos Yonca Brunini   Whoever cracks that and gives you the information you want is going to be the winner  We have to understand you to give you better results that are tailored to you   This is perhaps the Holy Grail of search understanding what it is you are looking for and providing it quickly  The problem is that no one yet knows how to get there

Yahoo moves into desktop search    Internet giant Yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e mail and other files on their PCs     The firm is following in the footsteps of Microsoft Google and Ask Jeeves which have offered similar services  Search has become a lucrative and hotly contested area of expansion for net firms looking to extend loyalty beyond the web  With hard drives providing bigger storage users could need more help to locate important files such as photos     The desktop search technology has been licensed from a US based firm X Technologies  It is designed to work alongside Microsofts Outlook and Outlook Express e mail programs  Searching e mail effectively is becoming increasingly important especially as the amount of spam increases  According to research from message analysts the Radicati Group up to   of businesses critical information is stored in e mail and attachments  Yahoos software can also work separately on the desktop searching for music photos and other files  Users can search under a variety of criteria including file name size date and time  It doesnt yet incorporate web searching although Yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web based and desktop data   We are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content  said Julian Smith an analyst with research firm Jupiter   It is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well  he said  Search engines are often the first port of call for users when they go onto the web  The new foray into desktop search has rung alarm bells for human rights groups concerned about the implications to privacy  And not everyone is impressed with the functionality of such services  Alexander Linden vice president of emerging technologies at analyst firm Gartnerdownloaded the Google product but has since removed it   It was just not very interesting  he said  He believes the rush to enter the desktop business is just a way of keeping up with rivals   Desktop search is just one of many features people would like but Im suspicious of its usefulness  he said  More useful would be tools that can combine internet intranet and desktop search alongside improvements to key word searching he said

Rings of steel combat net attacks    Gambling is hugely popular especially with tech savvy criminals     Many extortionists are targeting net based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid  But now deep defences are being put in place by some of the UKs biggest net firms to stop these attacks  Increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures   Net firms are realising that its not just about anti virus and firewalls  said Paul King chief security architect at Cisco   There are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres   Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so called Distributed Denial of Service attacks was with intelligent net based systems  Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said Mr King  This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale     Malcolm Seagrave security expert at Energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with  megabytes of data over short periods of time  Bigger attacks sending down  megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said   It does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing  he said     So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said Mr Seagrave  However he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted  Maria Capella spokeswoman for net provider Pipex said that when DDoS attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days  The defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites   Its about understanding whats genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site  she said   We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile thats when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack  said Ms Capella  This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood     Typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi tech criminal that set off the virus  Hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets  Many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail     Most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult  Often Pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen   The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e mail  said Ms Capella   We ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning   Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up  Energis took a similar approach said Mr Seagrave   We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together  said Mr Seagrave  Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from  Information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests  He said Energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target   We have people in places where they shouldnt be monitoring tech sites  he said  Sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy   You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another  said Mr Seagrave

US hacker breaks into T Mobile    A man is facing charges of hacking into computers at the US arm of mobile phone firm T Mobile     The Californian man Nicholas Lee Jacobsen was arrested in October  Mr Jacobsen tried at least twice to hack T Mobiles network and took names and social security numbers of  customers said a company spokesman  The arrest came a year after T Mobile uncovered the unauthorised access  The US Secret Service has been investigating the case   T Mobile has stringent procedures in place where we monitor for suspicious activity so that limited his activities and we were able to take corrective action immediately  Peter Dobrow a T Mobile spokesperson said  It is thought that Mr Jacobsens hacking campaign took place over at least seven months during which time he read e mails and personal computer files according to court records     Although Mr Jacobsen  managed to get hold of some data it is thought he failed to get customer credit card numbers which are stored on a separate computer system said Mr Dobrow  T Mobile confirmed that the US Secret Service was also looking into whether the hacker accessed photos that T Mobile subscribers had taken with their camera phones  The Associated Press agency reported that Mr Jacobsen also read personal files on the Secret Service agent who was apparently investigating the case  A Los Angeles grand jury indicted Mr Jacobsen with intentionally accessing a computer system without authorisation and with the unauthorised impairment of a protected computer between March and October   He is currently on bail  T Mobile is a subsidiary company of Deutsche Telekom and has about   million subscribers in the US

Windows worm travels with Tetris    Users are being warned about a Windows virus that poses as the hugely popular Tetris game     The Cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on PCs that it has infected  While users play the game the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks  The risk of infection by Cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild     The Cellery worm does not spread via e mail like many other viruses  Instead it browses computer networks for PCs that have not shut off all the insecure ways they connect to other machines  When it infects a machine Cellery installs a version of Tetris that users can play  As the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it  At the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines  The virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds  Productivity may suffer too if users spend time playing Tetris  PCs running Windows   ME NT  and XP could be vulnerable to the worm   If your company has a culture of allowing games to be played in the office your staff may believe this is simply a new game that has been installed   rather than something that should cause concern  said Graham Cluley spokesman for anti virus firm Sophos  So far the number of people infected by Cellery is thought to be very small and the risks of further infection is very low  Sophos urged users and companies to update their anti virus software to keep themselves protected

US state acts to stop spammers    US state Texas has filed a lawsuit against two men believed to be among the worlds top five spammers     It is seeking millions of dollars in damages in a civil lawsuit filed earlier this week  The Texas attorney general said it started the legal action as messages sent by the alleged spammers broke three laws governing e mail marketing  The company named in the lawsuit denied any wrongdoing and said it complied with all relevant laws     The Texas lawsuit was filed against Ryan Samuel Pitylak a University ofTexas student and Mark Stephen Trotter of California  Both are thought to be the top executives in three companies   PayPerAction LLC  Leadplex LLC  and Leadplex Inc   that are suspected of sending out many millions of unwanted e mail messages   Illegal spam must be stopped  said Greg Abbott Texas attorney general announcing the legal action   Spam is one of the most aggravating and pervasive problems facing consumers today   The attorney general alleges that messages sent by Mr Pitylak and Mr Trotters companies broke the  Controlling the Assault of Non Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act Can Spam as well as the Texas Electronic Mail and Solicitation Act and Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act  All three acts confer cash penalties for each violation of their terms  If the men are found guilty and all penalties are applied the two men could face a damages bill running into millions  Mr Abbott said the messages sent by the pair broke laws by using misleading subject lines not identifying themselves as adverts and offering services for which they had no licence to do so in Texas  Lawyers for the alleged spammers said the lawsuit was groundless and the two men would defend themselves strongly against the accusations   Leadplex and PayPerAction are legitimate internet marketing companies that are in complete compliance with the federal Can Spam Act  said Lin Hughes speaking on behalf of Mr Pitylak and Mr Trotter  In a similar move the US Federal Trade Commission FTC has won a court order that stops an international group of spammers sending sexually explicit e mail  The FTC took the action because the messages being sent violated several parts of the CAN Spam Act  In particular the pornographic messages did not identify themselves as being sexually explicit had deceptive subject headings did not have working opt out mechanisms failed to mention they were adverts and did not give the senders real world address  The court order stops the spammers sending e mail and freezes assets prior to a hearing on a permanent injunction

Souped up wi fi is on the horizon    Super high speed wireless data networks could soon be in use in the UK     The governments wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called Ultra Wideband UWB  Ofcom wants to ensure that the arrival of UWB using devices does not cause problems for those that already use the same part of the radio spectrum  UWB makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances  One of the more likely uses of UWB is to make it possible to send DVD quality video images wirelessly to TV screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home  The technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second  UWB could also be used to create so called Personal Area Networks that let a persons gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves  The technology works over a range up to  metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data  At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas products with UWB chips built in got their first public airing     Currently use of UWB is only allowed in the UK under a strict licencing scheme   Were seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow UWB on a licence exempt basis  said a spokesman for Ofcom     Companies have until  March to respond  In April the EC is due to start its own consultation on Europe wide adoption of UWB  The cross Europe body for radio regulators known as the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations CEPT is carrying out research for this harmonisation programme  Early sight of the CEPT work has caused controversy as some think it over emphasises UWBs potential to interfere with existing users  By contrast a preliminary Ofcom report found that it would be quite straight forward to deploy UWB without causing problems for those that already use it  The Ofcom spokesman said it was considering imposing a  mask  or set of technical restrictions on UWB using devices   We would want these devices to have very strict controls on power levels so they can not transmit a long way or over a wide area  he said  Despite the current restrictions the technology is already being used  Cambridge based Ubisense has about  customers around the world using the short range radio technology said David Theriault standards and regulatory liaison for Ubisense  He said that UWB was driving novel ways to interact with computers   Its like having a  mouse all the time  he said  He said that European decisions on what to do with UWB allied with IEEE decisions on the exact specifications for it would help drive adoption  Prior to its adoption as a way for gadgets and computers to communicate UWB was used as a sensing technology  It is used to spot such things as cracks under the surface of runways or to help firemen detect people through walls
