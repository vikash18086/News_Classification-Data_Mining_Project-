Call centre users lose patience    Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up a survey suggests     Once past the welcome message callers on average hang up after just  seconds of listening to canned music  The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of   every year   Customers are getting used to the idea of an always available society  says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data which commissioned the survey  However call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls she says from just over   in  to a record    during last year  When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages the number of abandoned calls is even higher   a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait  One possible reason for the lack in patience Ms Diemont says is the fact that more customers are calling on the move using their mobile phones     The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres growing range of tasks   Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards insurance and current accounts  Ms Diemont says  Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand in hand with more training the survey found     In what Dimension Data calls an  alarming development  the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from  to just  days leaving  agents not equipped to deal with customers   This Ms Diemont warns is  scary  and not good for the bottom line either  Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers  As a result call centres have a high  churn rate  with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff  Resolution rates   the number of calls where a customers query is resolved to mutual satisfaction   are running at just    When the query is passed on to a second or third person   a specialist or manager   rates rise to about   but that is still well below the industry target of an   resolution rate     Suggestions that  outsourcing    relocating call centres to low cost countries like India or South Africa   is to blame are wrong Ms Diemont says     There are  no big differences in wait time and call resolution  between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world   You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place  she says  However companies that decide to  offshore  their operations are driven not just by cost considerations  Only   of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations  Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money  But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution  Nearly two thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres  They give three key reasons for not making the move       call centre operations are part of their business  core function       they are worried about the risk of going abroad      they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive  The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data and is based on in depth questionnaires of  call centres in  countries and five continents  What are your experiences with call centres Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves or do you want an immediate response And if you work in a call centre  did your training prepare you for your job

Yukos owner sues Russia for      The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for            The Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos main production arm Yugansk to state run oil group Rosneft for    to offset a massive back tax bill  Group Menatep the Gibraltar based holding company which controls   of Yukos says this was illegal  Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a   loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets     The Russian governments argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz   the units full name   was that Yukos owed more than   in back taxes for the years from  onwards  It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk     But critics say the sell off and the assault on Yukos finances are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control  According to Menatep the governments actions were contrary to the  Energy Charter Treaty which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments   We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation  said Tim Osborne a director of Group Menatep   The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today      Menatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from    to  virtually nothing  since  as a result of the Russian governments action as its shares have fallen    According to its Paris lawyer Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling the overall claim is based on that figure with a   addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then  Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague Mr Gaillard said  While Russia has signed the Charter it has never ratified it   which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case  But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature not ratification   Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it so as to attract foreign investors  he said     Yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection  It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk   first to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft  Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky  Mr Khodorkovsky currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own was one of the founders of Menatep  He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors

Why few targets are better than many    The economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in  were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the worlds leading economy by      But the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige  For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe doesnt become a global economic laggard  They are also about ensuring Europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of Asia India and China as well as with the economic might of the United States  Thats why there was a tone of urgency in the report out on Wednesday by the former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok  Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets five years on from their inception  His conclusion was simple  too many of the targets will be seriously missed     Lisbon risks becoming a  synonym for missed objectives and failed promises  his report said   The status quo is not an option      At risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society Europe has built it said  The report comes at a time when Europes competitive position is waning  The EUs economic growth rate is projected to be   this year and    next  While there has been growth in overall employment rates in Europe productivity lags behind that of the US  But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far  That has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years     As Mr Koks report noted   The ink had scarcely dried on the  Lisbon  agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded    The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit      The circumstances werent conducive to creating the  million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in   Neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development money needed if the EU was to meet its target of becoming a so called  knowledge based economy    The  Lisbon  vision is a compelling one but in order to do it society has to change  said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council a Brussels based citizen action group   What you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change  You find trade unions fighting change  But also the employers associations   Even though they tell you theyre in favour of change many are actually pushing for less competition more subsidy and less free market activity      But part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago  Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case they covered too much according to the Wim report  Economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion and even safety at sea  The agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised      Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing  the Kok report said   Everybody is responsible and thus no one   Thats why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to  key indicators with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth  It also recommends that the European Commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps theyre taking towards meeting the targets effectively  naming shaming and faming    Rhetoric and delivery dont necessarily go hand in hand  Mr Kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report   We dont have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another      On one point Mr Kok was very clear  The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy  The European economic and social model needs to change but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth  In that sense the Lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters  The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth   Its very ambitious  said John Palmer political director at the European Policy Centre a Brussels based think tank   This is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do  Its going to require quite new and innovative policies   But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesnt come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality  For example it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce  But it doesnt say how companies should be convinced to do this  It will be up to the incoming president of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso to adopt Mr Koks recommendations and press them on EU governments  Mr Barroso has said that the EUs competitiveness will be his top priority  He expects his five year term in office to be judged on Europes success in meeting the Lisbon agenda

GSK aims to stop Aids profiteers    One of the worlds largest manufacturers of HIV Aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills   supplied to poorer African countries   back into Europe for resale at far higher price     The company GlaxoSmithKline is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement  It is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way  This is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies  They want to maintain their profits but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti Aids drugs to the worlds poorest nations     The result is that drugs supplied to Africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in Europe  bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of HIV positive Africans through their governments health care systems     But the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re selling them at a higher price  GlaxoSmithKline believes that by coating the pills destined for Africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging then this trade can be substantially reduced  The company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in Africa who have re sold humanitarian drugs for profit as well as those suppliers in Europe that have also been involved in the trade  Glaxo says distribution of the new look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in Europe

Cuba winds back economic clock    Fidel Castros decision to ban all cash transactions in US dollars in Cuba has once more turned the spotlight on Cubas ailing economy     All conversions between the US dollar and Cubas  convertible  peso will from  November be subject to a   tax  Cuban citizens who receive money from overseas and foreign visitors who change dollars in Cuba will be affected  Critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards reflecting the Cuban presidents desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise  In a live television broadcast announcing the measure President Castros chief aide said it was necessary because of the United States increasing  economic aggression    The ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the US government to suffocate our country  he said     The Bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on Cuba in recent months  President Bushs government which has been a strong supporter of the  year old trade embargo on Cuba introduced even tighter restrictions on Cuba in May     Cubans living in the US are now limited to one visit to Cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives  A leading expert on the Cuban economy says that Castros tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture   I think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash  says Jose Barrionuevo head of strategy for Latin American emerging markets for Barclays Capital   It underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue      The tax will hit the families of Cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home  This money known as remittances can amount to as much as   a year  Those remaining in Cuba will have to pay the tax  Their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax such as euros or increase their dollar payments to compensate  However many of Cubans poorest citizens could be worse off as a result  The tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit Cuba every year particularly those Americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there     Cubas tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and according to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America is now worth   to the country     The tax is designed to provide much needed revenue for Cubas cash strapped economy  Cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food fuel and medicine  Much of Cubas basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair  In recent weeks Cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island  Cubas economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid  as the collapse of the Soviet Union forced it to embrace foreign capital decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise  However a decline in foreign tourism since  periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy  It has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the governments economic problems  The tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading Mr Barrionuevo said   The main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries like Venezuela which have restrictions on capital  he says  Mr Barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity   It is intended to be a permanent measure but I am not sure it can last too long

Q A  Malcolm Glazer and Man Utd    The battle for control of Manchester United has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from US business tycoon Malcolm Glazer     No formal offer has been made yet but Manchester United have confirmed they have received a  detailed proposal  from the US entrepreneur which could lead to a bid  Reports have put the offer at  per share which would value Manchester United at about        The approach by the  year old owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team is reportedly being led by his two sons Avi and Joel  A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down  However the BBC has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand     Mr Glazers previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover  That would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed  not    in the best interests of the company  by Manchester Uniteds board when they rejected his approach last year  However Mr Glazers latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by        While Uniteds board may be casting a serious eye over Mr Glazers latest proposals supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal     Supporters group Shareholders United   which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazers campaign   said it would fight any move   Manchester United are a debt free company  We dont want to fall into debt and we dont need to fall into debt  Shareholders Uniteds Sean Bones told the BBC  Uniteds players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover   A lot of people want the clubs interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart  Rio Ferdinand told BBC Radio Five Live   No one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table      The key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of Uniteds largest shareholders the Irish horse racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus  Through their Cubic Expression vehicle they own    of the club  Mr Glazer owns     Joe McLean a football specialist at accountancy firm Grant Thornton said the support of Mr Magnier and Mr McManus was  utterly crucial    Mr Glazers bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment   If thats the case the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about  pence maybe    If thats the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support   if he does this bid could well go ahead      Indeed it is  Malcolm Glazer was little known in the UK until he started to build up his stake in Manchester United in late   In February  he said he was  considering  whether to bid for the club  No bid emerged but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club  In October  Manchester United said they had received a  preliminary approach  which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer  However the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve  At the clubs annual general meeting in November Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board  Legal adviser Maurice Watkins commercial director Andy Anson and non executive director Philip Yea were voted out against the wishes of chief executive David Gill  But the move led to bankers JP Morgan and public relations firm Brunswick withdrawing from the Glazer bid team

Making your office work for you    Our mission to brighten up your working lives continues   and this time were taking a long hard look at your offices     Over the next few months our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient more congenial or simply prettier  This week were hearing from Marianne Petersen who is planning to convert a barn in Sweden into a base for her freelance writing work  Click on the link under her photograph to read her story and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say  And if you want to take part in the series go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch     Working from home presents a multitude of challenges  Understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style  Do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others Are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done Do you build on the ideas of others   or are you a more introspective problem solver  In order for a virtual office to succeed keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential  It may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit and to keep strict office hours  Referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space  It is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network  Isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry  Joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like minded people may assist  It is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy   with the danger that when the workload eases they have to be resurrected         Prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water and weather tight and the structure is checked for stability  It appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing     Ideally the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn  This would also allow for a well insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured  It is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity  In order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate  Ideally it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities  The walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed and the walls should be painted in a light colour  The owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks  this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface  I would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn  As for lighting consider a combination of floor mounted uplights wall lights wall washers and selected downlights  Use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior         Please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for Mariannes barn     The layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space  Large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available  The finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace         Regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house your plan of going wireless is sensible  A wireless router access point in the house with a wireless LAN card in the PC in the renovated area may be sufficient  However important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass which could result in a weak signal strength  You may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area  Your local IT supplier will be able to advise on this  If you havent already invested in robust firewall and anti virus software it is essential to do so to protect your investment  To really take advantage of wireless technology you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor  Or you could use one of the new Tablet computers which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built in hand recognition software  And finally you will save money and space by considering a multi function product for print scan copy and fax

Market unfazed by Aurora setback    As the Aurora limped back to its dock on  January a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe     The ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble  And its owner P O Cruises   now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation   was looking at a significant slice chopped off this years profits and a potential PR fiasco  No one however seems to have told the stock markets  The warning of a five cent hit to  earnings came just  hours after one of the worlds biggest investment banks had upped its target for Carnivals share price from    to      Other investors barely blinked and by  GMT Carnivals shares in London were down a single penny or    at         Why the mismatch between the public perception and the markets response  The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time  says Deutsche Banks Simon Champion   It was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company   it was a long cruise after all  But the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one off events      Despite its string of bad luck he pointed out Aurora is just one vessel in a large Carnival fleet the UKs P O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in   And generally speaking Carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule   Carnival has an incredibly strong track record  Mr Champion     Similarly analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited  The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the Aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise  That should mitigate some of the PR risk both for Carnival and its main competitor Royal Caribbean   While not common cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry  wrote analysts from Citigroup Smith Barney in a note to clients on Friday   Moreover such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises   After all the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK   but for Carnival customers elsewhere its unlikely to make too much of a splash     Assuming that Citigroup is right and demand stays solid the structure of the industry also works in Carnivals favour  In the wake of P O Princesss takeover by Carnival the business is now to a great extent a duopoly  Given the expense of building outfitting and running a cruise ship  slowing supply growth  is a certainty said David Anders at Merrill Lynch on Thursday  In other words if you do want a cruise your options are limited  And with Carnival remaining the market leader it looks set to keep selling the tickets   no matter what happens to the ill fated Aurora in the future

The ticking budget facing the US    The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial  The Washington based Economic Policy Institute which tends to be critical of the President looks at possible fault lines  US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy  Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices the federal budget simply cannot hold together  News coverage of the Bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs  From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come  Under direct threat will be the federal governments ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund  As soon as  the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits     The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt which will grow in  years by conservative estimates to more than half the nations total annual output     This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business  Even now a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad  The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China among other nations  This does not bode well for US influence in the world  The decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue  The dollar is already sinking  Before too long credit markets are likely to react and interest rates will creep upwards  That will be the shock     Interest sensitive industries will feel pain immediately   sectors such as housing automobiles other consumer durables agriculture and small business  Some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the US Capitol in the late   There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget  The public outcry will force Congress to act  Whether it will act wisely is another matter  How did this happen    By definition the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending   but this neutral description doesnt adequately capture the current situation  Federal revenues are at  levels while spending remains where it has been in recent decades   much higher  In addition the United States has two significant military missions  The Bush administrations chosen remedy is the least feasible one  Reducing domestic spending or eliminating  waste fraud and abuse  is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem  Indeed if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way there would hardly be any such spending left  Law enforcement space exploration environmental clean up economic development the Small Business Administration housing veterans benefits aid to state and local governments would all but disappear  Its fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed  The biggest spending growth areas are defence including homeland security and health care for the elderly and the poor  To some extent increases in these areas are inevitable  The US population is aging and the nation does face genuine threats in the world  But serious savings can only be found where the big money is  Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system public and private  Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill serve the nations elderly and indigent     On the revenue side the lions share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since  will have to be replaced     Some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes  Finally blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned  There is no good reason to fixate on it anyway  Moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely  Borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense  The sooner we face that reality the sooner workable reforms can be pursued  First on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness eroded by the Bush tax cuts  Second should be a dispassionate re evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years much of it unrelated to Afghanistan Iraq or terrorism  Third must be the start of a serious debate on large scale health care reform  One thing is certain   destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century

Bush budget seeks deep cutbacks    President Bush has presented his  budget cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at      this year     The    trillion     trillion budget submitted to Congress affects  domestic programmes from farming to the environment education and health  But foreign aid is due to rise by   with more money to treat HIV Aids and reward economic and political reform  Military spending is also set to rise by    to reach     The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for which the administration is expected to seek an extra   from Congress later this year     Congress will spend several months debating George W Bushs proposal     The state departments planned budget would rise to just under     a fraction of the defence departments request   including almost   to assist US allies in the  war on terror   However the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle HIV Aids the BBCs Jonathan Beale reports and planned spending would almost double to   with much of that money going to African nations  Mr Bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his Millennium Challenge Corporation  The scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the US considers to be good governance and sound policies  Yet Mr Bushs proposed spending of   on that project is well below his initial promise of       A key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administrations proposed radical overhaul of Social Security the pensions programme on which many Americans rely for their retirement income     Some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to    trillion over a  year period  Neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the US emergency petroleum stockpile  Concern over the level of the reserve created in  has led to rises in oil prices over the past year  The Bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil   rather than cash   from energy companies that drill under federal leases     The outline proposes reductions in budgets at  out of  government agencies including cuts of    at Agriculture and    at the Environmental Protection Agency  The spending plan for the year beginning  October is banking on a healthy US economy to boost government income by    to    trillion  Spending is forecast to grow by    to    trillion  But the budget is still the tightest yet under Mr Bushs presidency   In order to sustain our economic expansion we must continue pro growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government  Mr Bush said in his budget message to Congress  Mr Bush has promised to halve the USs massive budget deficit within five years  The deficit partly the result of massive tax cuts early in Mr Bushs presidency has been a key factor in pushing the US dollar lower  The independent Congressional Budget Office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than   by  returning to the surpluses seen in the late  by   But its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent in line with the promise when they were passed that they would  sunset  or disappear in   Most Republicans however want them to stay in place  And the figures also rely on the  Social Security trust fund    the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions   being offset against the main budget deficit
